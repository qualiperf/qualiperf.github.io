  abstract: MRI-based biomechanical studies can provide a deep understanding of the
    mechanisms governing liver function, its mechanical performance but also liver
    diseases. In addition, comprehensive modeling of the liver can help improve liver
    disease treatment. Furthermore, such studies demonstrate the beginning of an engineering-level
    approach to how the liver disease affects material properties and liver function.
    Aimed at researchers in the field of MRI-based liver simulation, research articles
    pertinent to MRI-based liver modeling were identified, reviewed, and summarized
    systematically. Various MRI applications for liver biomechanics are highlighted,
    and the limitations of different viscoelastic models used in magnetic resonance
    elastography are addressed. The clinical application of the simulations and the
    diseases studied are also discussed. Based on the developed questionnaire, the
    papers' quality was assessed, and of the 46 reviewed papers, 32 papers were determined
    to be of high-quality. Due to the lack of the suitable material models for different
    liver diseases studied by magnetic resonance elastography, researchers may consider
    the effect of liver diseases on constitutive models. In the future, research groups
    may incorporate various aspects of machine learning (ML) into constitutive models
    and MRI data extraction to further refine the study methodology. Moreover, researchers
    should strive for further reproducibility and rigorous model validation and verification.

- title: Model order reduction for deformable porous materials in thin domains via
    asymptotic analysis
  authors: Armiti-Juber, Ricken T
  abstract: "We study fluid-saturated porous materials that undergo poro-elastic deformations\
    \ in thin domains. The mechanics in such materials are described using a biphasic\
    \ model based on the theory of porous media (TPM) and consisting of a system of\
    \ differential equations for material\u2019s displacement and fluid\u2019s pressure.\
    \ These equations are in general strongly coupled and nonlinear, such that exact\
    \ solutions are hard to obtain and numerical solutions are computationally expensive.\
    \ This paper reduces the complexity of the biphasic model in thin domains with\
    \ a scale separation between domain\u2019s width and length. Based on standard\
    \ asymptotic analysis, we derive a reduced model that combines two sub-models.\
    \ Firstly, a limit model consists of averaged equations that describe the fluid\
    \ pore pressure and displacement in the longitudinal direction of the domain.\
    \ Secondly, a corrector model re-captures the mechanics in the transverse direction.\
    \ The validity of the reduced model is finally tested using a set of numerical\
    \ examples. These demonstrate the computational efficiency of the reduced model,\
    \ while maintaining reliable solutions in comparison with original biphasic TPM\
    \ model in thin domain."

- title: Hepatectomy-Induced Alterations in Hepatic Perfusion and Function - Toward
    Multi-Scale Computational Modeling for a Better Prediction of Post-hepatectomy
    Liver Function

  abstract: Liver resection causes marked perfusion alterations in the liver remnant
    both on the organ scale (vascular anatomy) and on the microscale (sinusoidal blood
    flow on tissue level). These changes in perfusion affect hepatic functions via
    direct alterations in blood supply and drainage, followed by indirect changes
    of biomechanical tissue properties and cellular function. Changes in blood flow
    impose compression, tension and shear forces on the liver tissue. These forces
    are perceived by mechanosensors on parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells of the
    liver and regulate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions as well as cellular
    signaling and metabolism. These interactions are key players in tissue growth
    and remodeling, a prerequisite to restore tissue function after PHx. Their dysregulation
    is associated with metabolic impairment of the liver eventually leading to liver
    failure, a serious post-hepatectomy complication with high morbidity and mortality.
    Though certain links are known, the overall functional change after liver surgery
    is not understood due to complex feedback loops, non-linearities, spatial heterogeneities
    and different time-scales of events. Computational modeling is a unique approach
    to gain a better understanding of complex biomedical systems. This approach allows
    (i) integration of heterogeneous data and knowledge on multiple scales into a
    consistent view of how perfusion is related to hepatic function; (ii) testing
    and generating hypotheses based on predictive models, which must be validated
    experimentally and clinically. In the long term, computational modeling will (iii)
    support surgical planning by predicting surgery-induced perfusion perturbations
    and their functional (metabolic) consequences; and thereby (iv) allow minimizing
    surgical risks for the individual patient. Here, we review the alterations of
    hepatic perfusion, biomechanical properties and function associated with hepatectomy.
    Specifically, we provide an overview over the clinical problem, preoperative diagnostics,
    functional imaging approaches, experimental approaches in animal models, mechanoperception
    in the liver and impact on cellular metabolism, omics approaches with a focus
    on transcriptomics, data integration and uncertainty analysis, and computational
    modeling on multiple scales. Finally, we provide a perspective on how multi-scale
    computational models, which couple perfusion changes to hepatic function, could
    become part of clinical workflows to predict and optimize patient outcome after
    complex liver surgery.

- title: Semi-automated Data-driven FE Mesh Generation and InverseParameter Identification
    for a Multiscale and Multiphase Model ofFunction-Perfusion Processes in the Liver
  authors: Lambers Lena, Mielke Andre, Ricken Tim
  abstract: Biomechanical modeling enables a better understanding and prediction of
    various processes in the human body. To make thissimulation more patient-specific,
    realistic geometries of liver lobules are included in an existing knowledge-based
    model forthe simulation of hepatic function-perfusion processes in the human liver.
    This model allows the simulation of liver diseasessuch as the non-alcoholic fatty
    liver disease (NAFLD) or tumor development.  The basis of this calculation is
    a continuum-biomechanical multiscale and multiphase model based on the Theory
    of Porous Media.  To capture the function-perfusionand growth processes in the
    liver, partial differential equations (PDEs) on the lobule scale are coupled to
    ordinary differentialequations (ODEs) describing metabolic processes on the cellular
    scale.  Additionally, we used manifold learning techniqueson in silico data for
    the identification of inverted fat zonation during NAFLD.

    Enzyme 2 Expression in Lungs of Rats
  authors: "Kosacka J*, Berger C, Ceglarek U, Hoffmann A, Bl\xFCher M, Kl\xF6ting\

  abstract: "The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor has been identified\
    \ as the entry receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\
    \ 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is abundantly expressed in many organs. With respect to\
    \ the role of circulating ACE2 and its receptor expression in the pathogenesis\
    \ of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is still debated whether diseases such as hypertension\
    \ or pharmacotherapies, including ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers\
    \ that affect ACE2 receptor expression, may modulate the severity and outcome\
    \ of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We therefore tested the hypothesis\
    \ that treatment with the ACE inhibitor Ramipril affects organ-specific ACE2 receptor\
    \ mRNA and protein expression as well as the serum metabolome in BioBreeding (BB)\
    \ rats. Twelve male BioBreeding rats were randomly divided into a Ramipril (10\
    \ mg/kg body weight) treatment group or a control group (N = 12; n = 6 per group)\
    \ over a period of seven days. Ramipril treatment resulted in the reduction of\
    \ acylcarnitines (C3\u2013C6) out of 64 metabolites. Among the different organs\
    \ studied, only in the lungs did Ramipril treatment significantly increase both\
    \ Ace2 mRNA and ACE2 receptor membrane protein levels. Increased ACE2 receptor\
    \ lung expression after Ramipril treatment was not associated with differences\
    \ in ACE2 serum concentrations between experimental groups. Our data provide experimental\
    \ in vivo evidence that the ACE inhibitor Ramipril selectively increases pulmonary\
    \ ACE2 receptor mRNA and protein levels and reduces acylcarnitines."

    Serotonin-Positive Neurons in the Small Intestine in Pig Model'
  authors: "Bulc, M.; Palus, K.; Ca\u0142ka, J.; Kosacka, J.; Nowicki, M."
  abstract: 'Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) is an important neurotransmitter
    of the central

    and peripheral nervous systems, predominantly secreted in the gastrointestinal
    tract, especially in

    the gut. 5-HT is a crucial enteric signaling molecule and is well known for playing
    a key role in

    sensory-motor and secretory functions in the gut. Gastroenteropathy is one of
    the most clinical

    problems in diabetic patients with frequent episodes of hyperglycemia. Changes
    in 5-HT expression

    may mediate gastrointestinal tract disturbances seen in diabetes, such as nausea
    and diarrhea. Based

    on the double immunohistochemical staining, this study determined the variability
    in the population

    of 5-HT-positive neurons in the porcine small intestinal enteric neurons in the
    course of streptozotocininduced diabetes. The results show changes in the number
    of 5-HT-positive neurons in the examined

    intestinal sections. The greatest changes were observed in the jejunum, particularly
    within the

    myenteric plexus. In the ileum, both de novo 5-HT synthesis in the inner submucosal
    plexus neurons

    and an increase in the number of neurons in the outer submucosal plexus were noted.
    The changes

    observed in the duodenum were also increasing in nature. The results of the current
    study confirm

    the previous observations concerning the involvement of 5-HT in inflammatory processes,
    and an

    increase in the number of 5-HT -positive neurons may also be a result of increased
    concentration of

    the 5-HT in the gastrointestinal tract wall and affects the motor and secretory
    processes, which are

    particularly intense in the small intestines.'

  abstract: Computational models have great potential to accelerate bioscience, bioengineering,
    and medicine. However, it remains challenging to reproduce and reuse simulations,
    in part, because the numerous formats and methods for simulating various subsystems
    and scales remain siloed by different software tools. For example, each tool must
    be executed through a distinct interface. To help investigators find and use simulation
    tools, we developed BioSimulators (https://biosimulators.org), a central registry
    of the capabilities of simulation tools and consistent Python, command-line and
    containerized interfaces to each version of each tool. The foundation of BioSimulators
    is standards, such as CellML, SBML, SED-ML and the COMBINE archive format, and
    validation tools for simulation projects and simulation tools that ensure these
    standards are used consistently. To help modelers find tools for particular projects,
    we have also used the registry to develop recommendation services. We anticipate
    that BioSimulators will help modelers exchange, reproduce, and combine simulations.

  abstract: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) increasingly emerge as an option to ameliorate
    non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a serious disease, which untreated may progress
    to liver cirrhosis and cancer. Before clinical translation, the mode of action
    of MSC needs to be established. Here, we established NASH in an immune-deficient
    mouse model by feeding a high fat diet. Human bone-marrow-derived MSC were delivered
    to the liver via intrasplenic transplantation. As verified by biochemical and
    image analyses, human mesenchymal stromal cells improved high-fat-diet-induced
    NASH in the mouse liver by decreasing hepatic lipid content and inflammation,
    as well as by restoring tissue homeostasis. MSC-mediated changes in gene expression
    indicated the switch from lipid storage to lipid utilization. It was obvious that
    host mouse hepatocytes harbored human mitochondria. Thus, it is feasible that
    resolution of NASH in mouse livers involved the donation of human mitochondria
    to the mouse hepatocytes. Therefore, human MSC might provide oxidative capacity
    for lipid breakdown followed by restoration of metabolic and tissue homeostasis.

- title: An inverse transformation algorithm to infer parameter distributions from
    population snapshot data
  authors: "Vincent Wagner, Sebastian H\xF6pfl, Viviane Klingel, Maria C. Pop, Nicole\
    \ E. Radde"
  abstract: Population snapshot data can be used to study heterogeneity in cell populations.
    Various approaches to integrating such data into computational models have been
    published, which enable new treatment strategies for cancer therapy, by exploiting
    the intra-tumor heterogeneity. A precision medicine approach for the cure of cancer
    could benefit from the combination of single-cell data and respective analytical
    methods. Here, we introduce the inverse transformation algorithm, which transforms
    population snapshot data to parameter distributions that are consistent with the
    underlying data given a dynamic model with distributed parameters. Therefore,
    it enables the assessment of the heterogeneity in and behavior of the whole underlying
    cell population. In contrast to the frequently used Approximate Bayesian Computation
    methods for population matching, our algorithm is a non-parametric likelihood-free
    approach. It directly computes a density function value for a single parameter
    based on density transformation methods. If the model can be described as a one-to-one
    map that invertibly maps parameters to measurable outputs, the inverse transformation
    algorithm asymptotically returns the true underlying parameter distribution.

- title: Multimodale Therapie bei Lebermetastasen kolorektaler Karzinome in kurativer
    Intention
  authors: PD Dr. med. Hans-Michael Tautenhahn, Sandra Nickel, Eva Maria Kindler,
    Utz Settmacher
  abstract: Depending on the patient's constitution, the biological conditions of
    the primary tumor, the metastases and the liver function and perfusion, a variety
    of therapeutic options are available. The basis of metastatic surgery of the liver
    is partial liver resection. Multimodal therapies with local and systemic approaches
    are used in functionally or oncologically borderline situations. They are intended
    to improve long-term success and allow curative treatment in more patients. In
    recent years, for isolated lesions that cannot be removed by partial liver resection,
    an R0 situation is achieved in selected patients by liver transplantation with
    good long-term success. The large number of treatment options and the increasing
    individualization of therapy require treatment planning in the interdisciplinary
    tumor board. Also, in view of promising studies, for example, in the field of
    liver transplantation as well as regional therapy methods, the range of treatment
    options has not yet been exhausted.

- title: 'Quasi-Entropy Closure: A Fast and Reliable Approach to Close the Moment
    Equations of the Chemical Master Equation'
  authors: Wagner V, Castellaz B, Oesting M, Radde N
  abstract: Motivation The Chemical Master Equation is the most comprehensive stochastic
    approach to describe the evolution of a (bio-)chemical reaction system. Its solution
    is a time-dependent probability distribution on all possible configurations of
    the system. As the number of possible configurations is typically very large,
    the Master Equation is often practically unsolvable. The Method of Moments reduces
    the system to the evolution of a few moments of this distribution, which are described
    by a system of ordinary differential equations. Those equations are not closed,
    since lower order moments generally depend on higher order moments. Various closure
    schemes have been suggested to solve this problem, with different advantages and
    limitations. Two major problems with these approaches are first that they are
    open loop systems, which can diverge from the true solution, and second, some
    of them are computationally expensive.

  abstract: 'Motivation: This paper presents libRoadRunner 2.0, an extensible, high-performance,
    cross-platform, open-source software library for the simulation and analysis of
    models expressed using the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). Results: libRoadRunner
    is a self-contained library, able to run either as a component inside other tools
    via its C ++, C and Python APIs, or interactively through its Python or Julia
    interface. libRoadRunner uses a custom Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler built on the
    widely-used LLVM JIT compiler framework. It compiles SBML-specified models directly
    into native machine code for a large variety of processors, making it fast enough
    to simulate extremely large models or repeated runs in reasonable timeframes.
    libRoadRunner is flexible, supporting the bulk of the SBML specification (except
    for delay and nonlinear algebraic equations) as well as several SBML extensions
    such as hierarchical composition and probability distributions. It offers multiple
    deterministic and stochastic integrators, as well as tools for steady-state, sensitivity,
    stability and structural analyses. Availability: libRoadRunner binary distributions
    for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux, Julia and Python bindings, source code, and documentation
    are all available at https://github.com/sys-bio/roadrunner, and Python bindings

- title: Periportal steatosis in mice affects distinct parameters of pericentral drug
    metabolism

    \ L. O., Laue, H., Klopfleisch, R., Dahmen, U."
  abstract: Little is known about the impact of morphological disorders in distinct
    zones on metabolic zonation. It was described recently that periportal fibrosis
    did affect the expression of CYP proteins, a set of pericentrally located drug-metabolizing
    enzymes. Here, we investigated whether periportal steatosis might have a similar
    effect. Periportal steatosis was induced in C57BL6/J mice by feeding a high-fat
    diet with low methionine/choline content for either two or four weeks. Steatosis
    severity was quantified using image analysis. Triglycerides and CYP activity were
    quantified in photometric or fluorometric assay. The distribution of CYP3A4, CYP1A2,
    CYP2D6, and CYP2E1 was visualized by immunohistochemistry. Pharmacokinetic parameters
    of test drugs were determined after injecting a drug cocktail (caffeine, codeine,
    and midazolam). The dietary model resulted in moderate to severe mixed steatosis
    confined to periportal and midzonal areas. Periportal steatosis did not affect
    the zonal distribution of CYP expression but the activity of selected CYPs was
    associated with steatosis severity. Caffeine elimination was accelerated by microvesicular
    steatosis, whereas midazolam elimination was delayed in macrovesicular steatosis.
    In summary, periportal steatosis affected parameters of pericentrally located
    drug metabolism. This observation calls for further investigations of the highly
    complex interrelationship between steatosis and drug metabolism and underlying
    signaling mechanisms.

    Using Coupled Random Field and Extended Theory of Porous

    Media Contaminant Transport Models'
  authors: 'S. M. Seyedpour, C. Henning, P. Kirmizakis, S. Herbrandt, K. Ickstadt,
    R. Doherty

    and T. Ricken'
  abstract: 'To maximize the usefulness of groundwater flow models for the protection
    of aquifers and

    abstraction wells, it is necessary to identify and decrease the uncertainty associated
    with the major parameters such as permeability. To do this, there is a need to
    develop set of estimates representing subsurface heterogeneity or representative
    soil permeability estimates. Here, we use a coupled Random Field and extended
    Theory of Porous Media (eTPM) simulation to develop a robust model with a good
    predictive ability that reduces uncertainty. The coupled model is then validated
    with a physical sandbox experiment. Uncertainty is reduced by using 500 realisations
    of the permeability parameter using the eTPM approach. A multi-layer contaminant
    transport scenario with varying permeabilities, similar to what could be expected
    with shallow alluvial sediments, is simulated. The

    results show that the contaminant arrival time could be strongly affected by random
    field realizations of permeability compared with a modelled homogenous permeability
    parameter. The breakthrough time for heterogeneous permeabilities is shorter than
    the homogeneous condition. Using the 75% confidence interval (CI), the average
    contaminant concentration shows 4.4% variation from the average values of the
    considered area and 8.9% variation in the case of a 95% confidence interval.'

    A Continuum Mechanical Approach within the Framework of

  authors: S. M. Seyedpour, A. Thom and T. Ricken
  abstract: 'The simulation of contaminant transport through the vadose zone enjoys
    high significance

    for decision makers and contaminated site planners since the vadose zone can serve
    as a filter, but many contaminants can be transported from this region to aquifers.
    The intention of this paper is to utilize the extended Theory of Porous Media
    (eTPM) to develop a ternary model for the simulation of contaminant transport
    in the vadose zone whose application is subsequently shown via a numerical example.
    The simulation was conducted for 140 days, during which the contamination source
    was removed after 25 days. The results indicate that the contaminant reached the
    water table after 76 days. The concentration of the contaminant reaching the groundwater
    was 17% less than that of the contaminant source.'

- title: Bayesian estimation reveals that reproducible models in Systems Biology get
    more citations
  authors: "H\xF6pfl Sebastian, Pleiss J\xFCrgen, Radde Nicole"
  abstract: The Systems Biology community has taken numerous actions to develop data
    and modeling standards towards FAIR data and model handling. Nevertheless, the
    debate about incentives and rewards for individual researchers to make their results
    reproducible is ongoing. Here, we pose the specific question of whether reproducible
    models have a higher impact in terms of citations. Therefore, we statistically
    analyze 328 published models recently classified by Tiwari et al. based on their
    reproducibility. For hypothesis testing, we use a flexible Bayesian approach that
    provides complete distributional information for all quantities of interest and
    can handle outliers. The results show that in the period from 2013, i.e., 10 years
    after the introduction of SBML, to 2020, the group of reproducible models is significantly
    more cited than the non-reproducible group. We show that differences in journal
    impact factors do not explain this effect and that this effect increases with
    additional standardization of data and error model integration via PEtab. Overall,
    our statistical analysis demonstrates the long-term merits of reproducible modeling
    for the individual researcher in terms of citations. Moreover, it provides evidence
    for the increased use of reproducible models in the scientific community.

  authors: "John Gennari, Matthias K\xF6nig, Goskel Misirli, Maxwell Neal, David Nickerson,\

  abstract: A standardized approach to annotating computational biomedical models
    and their associated files can facilitate model reuse and reproducibility among
    research groups, enhance search and retrieval of models and data, and enable semantic
    comparisons between models. Motivated by these potential benefits and guided by
    consensus across the COmputational Modeling in BIology NEtwork (COMBINE) community,
    we have developed a specification for encoding annotations in Open Modeling and
    EXchange (OMEX)-formatted archives. This document details version 1.2 of the specification,
    which builds on version 1.0 published last year in this journal. In particular,
    this version includes a set of initial model-level annotations (whereas v 1.0
    described exclusively annotations at a smaller scale). Additionally, this version
    uses best practices for namespaces, and introduces omex-library.org as a common
    root for all annotations. Distributing modeling projects within an OMEX archive
    is a best practice established by COMBINE, and the OMEX metadata specification
    presented here provides a harmonized, community-driven approach for annotating
    a variety of standardized model representations. This specification acts as a
    technical guideline for developing software tools that can support this standard,
    and thereby encourages broad advances in model reuse, discovery, and semantic
    analyses.

    \ Karr, David Nickerson, Herbert Sauro, Dagmar Waltemath, and Matthias K\xF6nig"
  abstract: Computational simulation experiments increasingly inform modern biological
    research, and bring with them the need to provide ways to annotate, archive, share
    and reproduce the experiments performed. These simulations increasingly require
    extensive collaboration among modelers, experimentalists, and engineers. The Minimum
    Information About a Simulation Experiment (MIASE) guidelines outline the information
    needed to share simulation experiments. SED-ML is a computer-readable format for
    the information outlined by MIASE, created as a community project and supported
    by many investigators and software tools. The first versions of SED-ML focused
    on deterministic and stochastic simulations of models. Level 1 Version 4 of SED-ML
    substantially expands these capabilities to cover additional types of models,
    model languages, parameter estimations, simulations and analyses of models, and
    analyses and visualizations of simulation results. To facilitate consistent practices
    across the community, Level 1 Version 4 also more clearly describes the use of
    SED-ML constructs, and includes numerous concrete validation rules. SED-ML is
    supported by a growing ecosystem of investigators, model languages, and software
    tools, including eight languages for constraint-based, kinetic, qualitative, rule-based,
    and spatial models, over 20 simulation tools, visual editors, model repositories,
    and validators. Additional information about SED-ML is available at https://sed-ml.org/.
