  summary: 'Complex, extended liver resections (ePHx) pose a high risk of postoperative liver failure, especially in case of preexisting liver disease. We aim to improve our mechanistic understanding of the interplay between hepatic perfusion and function to an unprecedented level in order to allow individualized functional prediction when planning liver surgeries. We will achieve this goal by integrating systems biology methods and imaging techniques as well as multimodal, longitudinal personalized patient data. Our objectives of the ﬁrst funding phase (module 1) are (1) to quantify and better understand the interplay between perfusion, transcription, and selected metabolic functions at all relevant physiological scales in healthy and diseased—here: steatotic—livers; (2) to generate validated and integrated spatio-transient models for robust prediction of liver function after resection and during regeneration; and thus (3) to lay the foundation for a clinically applicable planning model for predicting the individual postoperative hepatic function and its course of recovery. In particular, we will elucidate how perfusion and function interact in normal and steatotic livers; how changes in lobar perfusion after portal vein ligation (PVL) impact on metabolic function; how resection-induced impairment of perfusion aggravates the loss of metabolic function of the remnant liver after ePHx; and how key repair processes during regeneration (normalization of perfusion, volume recovery, restoration of metabolic function at different levels (transcriptome, proteome) interact. In parallel, we will acquire selected patient data for validation of the modeling results, and verify how sensitive the prediction quality reacts to uncertainty in input data. Thereby, we will show that our experimentally driven, spatially resolved perfusion-metabolism model enables a highly accurate prediction of function (of the regenerating liver) compared to a merely volume-based estimate. In analogy to animal experiments, clinical data will be used to adapt the organ model to the patient. The goal of the second funding phase (module 2) is an individualized prediction of function of steatotic livers after ePHx based on our models. For this purpose, we will extend our models by patient-speciﬁc extrahepatic factors such as comorbidities, age, and liver-gut interactions inﬂuenced by the microbiome. Our long-term vision is an application, integrated in the hospital information system, which allows an accurate estimate of liver regeneration and post-surgical morbidity and mortality already when virtually planning the surgery.'

  summary: 'In order to reach the goals of QuaLiPerF, we designed the Coordination Project consisting of different modules. We apply for a coordinator responsible for all administrative tasks in QuaLiPerF. “Measures for advanced research careers” are addressed by granting in-house start-up funds, organizing annual workshops and enabling the supervision of doctoral students along QualiPerF guidelines for qualification.  To ensure family friendly working conditions and attract female researchers, the module “Gender Equality” contains a gender task force responsible for all related topics. The modules are complemented by the module “Network Funds”, e.g, for high performance computers and qualification measures and the module “Public Relation”, that should serve the dissemination of our results via all media.'

  title: 'Metabolic profiling of the hepatic sinusoid'
  tags:
    - Experiments
  summary: 'The comprehensive aim of the Research Unit “QuaLiPerF” is to compile a computational model encompassing the quantitative relationship between liver perfusion and metabolic functions in the context of liver surgery. In the long-term range this will support surgical planning and risk stratification. It may be assumed that liver surgery-induced perfusion perturbation may impact on hepatic metabolic functions. However, global function may not reflect the situation on the cellular level, since metabolic pathways are heterogeneously distributed in the liver parenchyma in a zonal pattern along the hepatic sinusoids. Therefore, the understanding of liver function on the organ level requires the understanding on the cellular level to establish a multi-scale computational model for the prediction of surgery-induced perfusion and function changes. Yet, while metabolic zonation per se is well documented, the quantitative relationship between perfusion changes and metabolic control on the sinusoidal level and their mutual interactions are unknown so far. We hypothesize that metabolic functions of the hepatocytes ultimately depend on the mitochondrial oxidative capacity providing energy for post-surgery organ regeneration. Yet, mitochondrial function may be exhausted by threshold perfusion restrictions, eventually causing hepatocyte dysfunction and metabolic impairment. Our project “Metabolic profiling of the hepatic sinusoid” aims to correlate steatosis- and surgery-induced changes in liver perfusion with changes of hepatocyte metabolic control coupled to mitochondrial function on the sinusoidal level in the rat model. We will provide as yet unknown quantitative data on the zonal distribution and dynamics of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism regulated by perfusion changes as induced by lipid overload and liver surgery. Further, we will define as yet unknown zonal mitochondrial activity as a function of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and identify mitochondrial dysfunction induced by flow restrictions as a potential pathomechanism in post-surgery liver failure. Finally, we will provide quantitative data for input into models of simulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism on the tissue and cellular scale. Thus, the project contributes data for computational modelling in joint projects of the Research Unit on the tissue and cellular level, and supports elucidation of biological mechanisms of perfusion control of metabolic zonation in the context of liver surgery. Mutual iterative interactions of the projects in the Research Unit will support model validation and textual refinement of experiments in order to improve model predictions as well as experimental strategies.'

  title: 'Impact of hepatic perfusion on lobular and lobar distribution of test compound metabolism
in rats'
  tags:
    - Experiments
  summary: 'Patients subjected to extended liver resection ((e)PHx) have a high risk to experience postoperative liver dysfunction or even liver failure, especially in case of preexisting liver disease. Our research group QuaLiPerF aims to enhance the understanding of the quantitative and spatial relationship between hepatic perfusion and function in healthy, steatotic and regenerating livers after surgery using a systems medicine approach. This project will focus on assessing the impact of perfusion perturbation and perfusion impairment on loss and recovery of liver function. We hypothesize that spatial inhomogeneity of perfusion matches the functional performance of the hepatocytes and their proliferation during regeneration. It is our aim to assess the impact of hepatic perfusion on test compound metabolism in normal, steatotic and regenerating livers by a)	spatially resolved quantification of hepatic perfusion and steatosis on the lobular and lobar scale, b)	exploring the capacity and spatial distribution of test compound metabolism in relation to hepatocyte proliferation. To reach this goal, we are going to investigate liver perfusion impairments on multiple scales using three different approaches of perfusion perturbation in the rat model: hepatic steatosis, portal vein ligation, and liver resection. Animals will be subjected to detailed assessment of hepatic hemodynamics and microcirculation using side-stream dark field imaging and an optical sensor revealing the tissue oxygenation. Probing multiple liver lobes will reveal the heterogeneity of hepatic perfusion. Test  compound metabolism is used for scale spanning assessment of hepatic function. We will perform pharmacokinetic studies after applying five different test compounds. We will analyze metabolism of these drugs by determination of the corresponding CYP enzyme activity, measurement of protein and mRNA levels and determination of zonal expression in tissue samples obtained from different liver lobes to account for heterogeneity. Liver regeneration will be assessed immediately after surgery and within the first postoperative week by addressing liver-to-body-weight ratios, volume and functional recovery as well as proliferation of hepatocytes. These results will be compared to detailed MRI assessment of liver volume, perfusion and function. Our results will be complementary to investigations of the carbohydrate/lipid metabolism and a detailed gene expression analysis. Thus, a comprehensive network of metabolic control assessment as a function of liver perfusion will be generated. All experimental data together with corresponding clinical data will serve as input for the integrated computational models needed for spatially resolved prediction of regeneration and functional recovery of the future liver remnant after liver surgery. As a result, prediction of function and risk stratification for patients undergoing (e)PHX will be improved.'

  title: 'Computational modelling of liver metabolism and function'
  summary: 'The overarching goal of the QuaLiPerF research unit is to improve the mechanistic understanding of the interplay between hepatic perfusion and metabolic function in healthy and steatotic livers and their responses under surgical intervention. This is achieved by a systems medicine approach, in which experimentalists and modelers closely work. This project - computational modelling of liver metabolism and function - investigates factors important for the metabolic functional capacity of the liver. To this end we will contribute to the overall work program computational models of carbohydrate/lipid metabolism (CH/L) and metabolism of hepatic test compounds (TC) on the cellular and whole-body scale. The objectives of the project are to elucidate the effects of lipid accumulation, changes in perfusion, hepatectomy, and regeneration on hepatic metabolism and function. In detail, we will study the effects on hepatic metabolism and function of: (i) lipid accumulation in NAFLD; (ii) changes in global perfusion to sections of the liver in portal vein ligation (PVL); (iii) changes due to hepatectomy (removal of liver volume in model either with/without changes in perfusion and/or metabolism); (iv) regeneration of liver volume (with/without accompanying changes in perfusion and/or metabolism). Due to the central role of hepatic metabolism in the evaluation of liver function the project will establish methods and workflows to provide reproducible and interoperable models based on standard exchange formats. This will facilitate the coupling of the models to the other modelling projects, uncertainty analysis and parameter estimation, and integration of experimental and clinical data with the models.'

  title: 'Interaction between liver transcriptome and gut microbiome: Impact on hepatic function and
on regeneration after (e)PHX'
  tags:
    - Experiments
  summary: 'The Research Unit FOR 5151 QuaLiPerF aims to enhance the understanding of the quantitative and spatial relationship between hepatic perfusion and function in healthy, steatotic and regenerating livers using a systems surgery approach. P4 will focus on analyzing the transcriptome differences of healthy liver (WP A, F), steatotic liver (WP A, F), venous ligated liver lobe (WP C, F) and during regeneration (WP D). For each liver condition, we specifically distinguish spatial information between perivenous and periportal liver. The observed genes (with a focus on non-coding RNAs and isoforms) serve as potential marker genes for regeneration capacity and potential therapeutic targets. The results of this project will be input for the metabolic and multiscale computational models generated in QuaLiPerF (P3, P5, P7, P8) to limit the parameter space of the PDE and ODEs to describe the function and perfusion restricted liver more accurately. Finally, we will make first steps in analyzing the difference of the gut microbiome of healthy human and steatotic liver patients. With this project we contribute essentially to the understanding of the liver perfusion and function, which is the ultimate goal of QuaLiPerF.'

  title: 'Statistical methods for data integration into multi-scale models and uncertainty tracking'
  tags:
    - Data integration
  summary: 'The goal of QuaLiPerF is an advanced understanding of the interplay between surgery-induced changes in perfusion and metabolic function for improving predictions of functions and risk stratification for patients subjected to (extended) liver resection (ePHx). This will be achieved by a systems medicine approach. Based on our previous work, we will build spatially and temporally resolved multi-scale models of hepatic function, perfusion and liver regeneration. Therefore, a variety of data will be generated during the course of the project or is available from other studies. The integration of experimental data into these models is a challenging task, which requires multiple decisions during the modeling and calibration procedure. P5 provides methodology for smart data integration and uncertainty quantification across the modeling projects (P3, P7 and P8). Furthermore, it develops methods to integrate patient-specific factors in order to enable individualized risk assessment in the context of liver surgery and liver regeneration after surgery. For this purpose, we will use statistical Bayesian and likelihood-based approaches for parameter estimation, uncertainty quantification and model validation. A challenge thereby will be computational costs especially for multi-scale models, since these methods often require many forward simulations. Here, together with P3, P7 and P8 we will develop methodology for up-scaling by exploiting efficient sampling schemes and model reduction techniques. Patient-specific clinical data will be provided by P9, from which features will be selected via correlations with regenerative capacity and post-operative risk assessment. Subsequently, we will develop a scheme to integrate these features into patient-specific models. Methodology of P5 will ultimately equip model predictions with confidence bounds, thereby judging the reliability and specificity of model predictions. This will not only allow to analyze model plausibility and model validation, but will also be useful in a second funding phase to foster an even tighter experiment-modeling cycle. Ultimately, QuaLiPerF will allow an improved model-based prediction of the recovery of the liver function, thus helping to improve planning of individual surgeries in the future.'

  title: 'In vivo assessment of liver function, perfusion and fat distribution in the animal model by
using MRI'
  tags:
    - Experiments
  summary: 'Within the overarching goal of the research unit QuaLiPerF to gain a data-integrated, multi-scale understanding of the interplay between hepatic perfusion and function and its recovery after extended hepatectomy (ePHx), this subproject (P6) is devoted to experimental MRI investigations in rats. This subproject aims to establish a comprehensive MR imaging toolbox for small animal imaging at 9.4T and to provide MRI-based spatially resolved, multi-parametric quantitative in vivo information on liver size, function, and perfusion under various experimental conditions. More specifically, in this project, MRI examinations are performed on rats before and after portal vein ligation (PVL) and partial hepatectomy, and animals are monitored longitudinally during regeneration. In addition, the effects of a fat diet on the different MRI parameters, used to characterize the liver status, will also be investigated longitudinally. These data serve to monitor adaptations after PVL and the regenerative response of the remnant liver after ePHx and – together with complementary experimental and clinical data from the subprojects P1, P2, P4, and P9 of the research unit – form an important source of information for comparison of the predicted temporal changes provided by the mathematical models of the subprojects P3, P7 and P8 on the organ scale. Subproject P6 will also be in exchange with subproject P5, which aims to integrate the data into models on different scales based on statistical approaches. Upon completion of the first funding period of the research unit, a substantial body of experimental in vivo data will be available, which together with the iterative computational modeling and data integration will allow a better prediction of the recovery of liver function.'

  tags:
    - Modeling
  summary: 'The project is part of the research group 5151 "Quantification of the liver perfusion-function relationship in complex resection - a systems medicine approach" (QuaLiPerF). Within this research unit, this project aims to numerically simulate the mechanically and biologically coupled perfusion-function processes on the lobular level. The hepatic lobular level is the connection between the next larger (organ vascular system) and the next smaller (cell system) level. This allows the simulation of two- and three-dimensional (2D/3D) liver lobule groups (up to 20). We will study the changes in blood perfusion during fat accumulation and calculate the transient spatial distribution of fat accumulation in the liver lobules. The model will provide information on perfusion changes induced by fat accumulation via portal vein ligation (PVL) and liver resection ((e)PHx). We will extend the model to simulate tissue growth and structural changes during liver regeneration. A time-dependent reorientation approach of the sinusoids will be incorporated. The deformation, flow and transport processes will be modelled using a system of coupled partial differential equations (PDE), while the metabolic processes and fat accumulation will be described using a systems biology approach using a system of ordinary differential equations (PDE-ODE coupling). The high-resolution, hyperelastic and porous lobular model is developed and verified within a thermodynamically consistent continuum mechanical multiphase and multi-scale approach. The model is directly founded on first principles of mechanics and based on the extended theory of porous media (eTPM). In addition, the lobular model is linked to the macro-vessel system at the organ level via coupled boundary values. The variations in blood perfusion and heterogeneity in the liver lobules are transferred to the organ multi-scale model during fat accumulation, after PVL, after (e)PHx and during regeneration. We will increase computational speed and efficiency by approaches to model reduction. Methods for this are the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) or a combination of both. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are to be used as a surrogate model for the high-fidelity multi-phase and multi-scale models. Finally, we will lay the foundation for the long-term vision of the research unit to build a clinically applicable 3D modelling computer tool that enables function-based surgical planning and risk assessment. As a proof-of-concept study, we will visualize clinical and simulation data using a commercial program to create a first demonstration of impaired function and perfusion at organ and lobular level after a predetermined resection.'

    - Modeling
  summary: 'The goal of the research unit is to better predict the recovery of hepatic function during regeneration after liver surgery of diseased livers. Hepatic disease affect hepatic processes at different spatial scales: individual hepatocytes, hepatic sinusoids/lobuli (including zonated phenomena), the organ, and the entire organism. Surgery and subsequent regeneration further perturb the hepatic processes at the different scales. In QuaLiPerF, these effects will be included in computational models of the metabolization of selected test compounds representative for liver function. The goal of this project is to build a multi-scale computational model of test compound metabolism during liver regeneration. For this purpose, this project will integrate models at the cellular, lobular, and organism scale (by the modeling partners) with own models at the organ scale, in a four- scale framework. Combining the relevant complex and interacting processes in a computational model will require a deep understanding of the underlying physiology, biology, and biochemistry and of suitable modeling techniques for the respective spatial scales. Our mechanistically driven model translation and integration will be complemented by a data-driven approach in collaboration with the data integration partner. The computational models to be developed will be parameterized and validated using clinical and experimental physiological and metabolic data. In addition, this project will combine the data acquired during regeneration to descriptive computational model of the recovery of physiological and metabolic parameters over time, to be combined with the models of test compound metabolization. Predictions obtained from simulations using the computational models will be used in QuaLiPerF to investigate biological and clinical questions driven by the clinical and experimental partners. Ultimately, a better prediction of the recovery of liver function developed in QuaLiPerF will help improve planning of individual surgery. '

  summary: 'Complex, extended liver resections (e)PHx pose a high risk of postoperative liver failure to the patient, especially in case of preexisting liver disease. We aim to improve our mechanistic understanding of the interplay between hepatic perfusion and function to an unprecedented level in order to allow individualized functional prediction for the planning of liver surgeries. We will achieve this goal by integrating systems biology methods and imaging techniques as well as multimodal, longitudinal personalized patient data. The project presented will design and initiate a proof of concept trial including patients subjected to extended liver resection. Selected patients (ECOG Performance Status 2/3, n=25/year) will undergo an extensive imaging (US, MRI, CT-scan), hemodynamic assessment (invasive blood pressure, ultrasound measured hemodynamics such as flow, pressure, and resistance index) and detailed assessment of hepatic function. Quantitative time course data of liver function tests (LiMON/LiMAx) together with corresponding anthropometric information, patient history, and lifestyle information will be provided to organ and tissue computational models for multi-scale and multi-modal integration. Total liver volume and hepatic perfusion will be provided for input into tissue- and organ-scale models. Fasting plasma biochemistry (ALT; AST; insulin; glucose; glucagon; lipid profile, e.g., triglycerides and free fatty acids), and oral glucose tolerance tests (quantitative time courses of glucose and insulin after glucose challenge) representing whole-body carbohydrate and lipid metabolism will be provided for tissue models of simulation. Quantitative/qualitative data on heterogeneity of perfusion and fat content on the organ level will be provided for organ-scale models in cooperation with quantitative image analysis projects. Tissue samples will be provided for quantitative histological analysis, -omics, microbiome, and metabolic profiling also needed for input into tissue- and organ-scale models. Additionally, these are needed to generate individualized models simulating the postoperative clinical course after liver surgery. The ultimate goal of this project is to improve prediction of regeneration after liver resection by a better understanding of liver perfusion and liver function based on a computational multi-scale model of simulation.'

  title: 'Service Project: Data Management'
  summary: 'For an interdisciplinary research network like QuaLiPerF, an efficient and comprehensive data management is essential for its success. This service project is designed to organize all aspects of data management and to support sharing and storage of data within and outside of the research unit. The goal of the data management project is to offer all members of QuaLiPerF an optimal support regarding data management. This includes the secure systematic handling, storage and sharing of data generated within QuaLiPerF, as well as ensuring data quality and documentation. We will strictly adhere to the F.A.I.R. data principles. Long-term re-usability for the scientific community is of particular importance. This applies to experimental laboratory data, anonymized patient data, as well as to data created by the modelers. QuaLiPerF will strictly adhere to established general and discipline-specific standards for data handling and long-term data storage and will implement comprehensive data control and management procedures. We will setup a joint repository with convention-based file naming and folder structure. The main task of the designated data manager is to ensure the adherence of all participating scientists in all projects to the data management plan. The data manager also has to secure the data storage and is responsible for backups. This includes documentation of structures, regulations and processes in our project wiki. Finally, this project will organize long term storage of data generated within QuaLiPerF and will assure accessibility of the data for the scientific community at the end of the project.'
