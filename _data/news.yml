  abstract: "Background/Purpose\nHepatobiliary research in clinical and experimental-surgery\
    \ requires the assessment of liver function. One important parameter of liver\
    \ function is drug metabolism (DM). DM is a\uFB00ected by the underlying liver\
    \ disease, liver-surgery, and the subsequent disturbance of hepatic perfusion\
    \ (HP). However, DM is also a\uFB00ected by the species in question. For translational\
    \ purposes, it is therefore of importance to compare key aspects of DM in di\uFB00\
    erent species.\nMethods\nFirst, we assess the impact of species on DM in normal\
    \ liver-tissue by comparing CYP-expression and\nactivity in three widely used\
    \ species (mouse, rat, pig) in comparison to human samples.\nSecond, we investigate\
    \ the impact of HP on DM. Therefore, we use rats and mice with a particular\n\
    impairment of HP: (1) moderate hepatic steatosis inducing heterogeneous perfusion\
    \ due to zonal and lobular inhomogeneous fat accumulation in hepatocytes and (2)\
    \ 70% partial hepatectomy (PH) inducing portal hyperperfusion due to the loss\
    \ of liver mass.\nCYP-expression is visualized using immunohistochemistry and\
    \ quanti\uFB01ed by image analysis (Histokat, Fraunhofer Mevis) in whole slide\
    \ scans (Nanozoomer, Hamamatsu). CYP-activity is assessed in cryo-preserved liver-tissue\
    \ utilizing model-reactions.\nResults\nPericentral expression of all CYP-isozymes\
    \ in mice and humans extends to zone2. CYP-expression in rats is limited to 2-3\
    \ lines of hepatocytes, except CYP1A2 extending to zone2. In pigs, CYP1A2 is expressed\
    \ in the whole liver lobule.\nIn mice, steatosis induced by feeding a methionine-choline\
    \ de\uFB01cient but fat-enriched diet for 2-4 weeks did neither a\uFB00ect CYP-activity\
    \ nor CYP-distribution pattern, with one exception (signi\uFB01cantly higher CYP2E1-\
    \ activity as revealed by the model reaction p-Nitrophenol-Hydroxylation).\nIn\
    \ contrast, CYP-expression in the hyperperfused remnant liver was reduced in terms\
    \ of signal intensity and distribution 24h after 70%PH in both species.\nConclusions\
    \ \nCYP-expression pattern in normal mouse liver is similar to normal human liver,\
    \ whereas normal rat and pig liver present with di\uFB00erent distribution patterns.\
    \ However, surgery-induced substantial hyperperfusion caused similar relative\
    \ changes in rats and mice.\nIn conclusion, mice seem to be the most suitable\
    \ species for DM-studies. Rats can be used as well, if relative changes are of\
    \ importance. However, translation of results into the human setting should be\
    \ done\nwith caution."

  title: Bayesian statistics for uncertainty quantification of a physiologically based
    model of indocyanine green liver function tests
  authors: "H\xF6pfl Sebastian, K\xF6nig Matthias , Radde Nicole"
  abstract: 'Quantitative modeling in a medical context is often accompanied by sparse
    and noisy data, resulting in ill-posed optimization problems for model calibration.
    In addition, data varies considerably among different samples and subjects, reflecting
    interindividual heterogeneity. For a personalized medicine approach, the individual
    differences between patients must be considered to provide reliable predictions
    which support decisions about treatment options. This can be done via computational
    modelling, integrating heterogeneous data types and information from various sources
    into a holistic framework. Our project contributes towards an advanced understanding
    of liver function in the research unit QuaLiPerF, by providing the statistical
    methodology for a consistent estimation of uncertainty in kinetic models. This
    estimation is a prerequisite for the risk assessment of (extended) liver resections
    and the prediction of accurate recovery courses for individual patients.


    We have developed a workflow which uses statistical approaches for uncertainty
    tracking from heterogeneous and sparse data, via model parameters to model predictions.
    If computationally feasible, we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to
    assess information about the uncertainties in terms of probability distributions.
    From these, credibility intervals for unobserved parameters and predictions are
    derived, which can aid clinical decisions.


    In a first approach, we apply methodology to a physiologically based model of
    the Indocyanine Green (ICG) liver function test. The model allows to predict postoperative
    liver function after hepatectomy as well as survival and includes data from multiple
    curated clinical studies. The data reflects a large heterogeneity due to individual
    differences in the patients and different reporting protocols. To ensure compliance
    with the FAIR principles, we make use of standard exchange formats such as the
    Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and PEtab. Parameter estimation and further
    uncertainty analysis is performed with advanced tools such as the Parameter EStimation
    TOolbox for python (pyPESTO), which ultimately allows to integrate these analysis
    steps into modeling workflows.

    Our analysis shows how statistical methodology for uncertainty quantification
    can be implemented in systems medicine modeling approaches. This contributes to
    personalized medicine by linking predictions for individual patients with their
    confidence, an important prerequisite for the application of predictive computational
    models in clinical decision workflows.'

  title: Differential gene expression analysis to determine liver perfusion and liver
    function
  authors: Daria Meyer, Manja Marz
  abstract: 'Differential gene expression analysis to determine liver perfusion and
    liver function


    Background/Purpose

    For the understanding of the quantitative and spatial relationship between hepatic
    perfusion and function in healthy, steatotic and regenerating livers using a systems
    surgery approach, we focus on analyzing the transcriptome differences of healthy
    liver, steatotic liver, venous ligated liver lobe and during regeneration.


    Methods

    The transcriptome gives insights into the state of the cells from that the genetic
    material was sequenced. For each liver condition, we specifically distinguish
    spatial information between perivenous and periportal liver and compare it to
    whole liver. For both periportal and perivenous liver cells the differences between
    healthy liver to steatotic liver and healthy liver to venous ligated liver lobe
    and non-ligated liver lobe can be analyzed. The observed genes (with a focus on
    non-coding RNAs and isoforms) serve as potential marker genes for regeneration
    capacity and potential therapeutic targets. Additionally, by analyzing differentially
    expressed genes pathways can be detected, that are activated during liver perfusion
    restriction, liver function restriction and liver regeneration.


    Results

    The results of this analysis can be input for the metabolic and multiscale computational
    models to limit the parameter space of models used to describe the function and
    perfusion restricted liver more accurately.


    Conclusions

    Thus RNA-Sequencing analysis contributes essentially to the understanding of the
    liver perfusion and function.'

  title: An In-silico Model of Coupled Function-Perfusion Processes in the Human Liver
    with Application to Steatosis and Tumor Growth
  authors: Lambers L, Ricken T
  abstract: "Computational multiphase and multiscale continuum-biomechanical modeling\
    \ of biological tissue can simulate the complex hepatic deformationperfusion-function\
    \ relationship and allow patient-specific prediction of\nliver surgery [1]. Our\
    \ goal is the precise mathematical description and\nnumerical simulation of the\
    \ liver lobules coupled to metabolic processes\nin the liver cells.\nFor the description\
    \ of liver tissue we apply a poro-visco-elastic homogenization approach using\
    \ the Theory of Porous Media [2] with an\nanisotropic blood flow [4, 5]. We consider\
    \ the control body \u03D5, which\nconsists of \u03BA main phases \u03D5\n\u03B1\
    . Each phase contains one carrier phase\n\u03D5\n\u03B1 and \u03BD \u2212 1 miscible\
    \ substances \u03D5\n\u03B1\u03B2. In detail, we account for a\nporous solid structure\
    \ representing healthy tissue (S), a liquid phase\ndescribing the blood (F), and\
    \ two solid phases with the ability of growth\nand depletion representing the\
    \ fat tissue (T) and the tumor tissue (C) as\nwell as substances like nutrients\
    \ or therapeutics.\nThe liver tissue stress and deformation as well as blood perfusion\
    \ and\npressure on the lobular scale are described with partial-differential equations\
    \ (PDEs), that are coupled to ordinary differential equations (ODEs)\non the cellular\
    \ scale for the calculation of hepatic processes as well as\nthe production, utilization\
    \ and storage of the involved metabolites.\nThe results show a zonated accumulation\
    \ of fat in the liver lobule. The\nstorage of fat causes tissue growth with a\
    \ negative impact on the blood\nflow wFS, shown by the relation between the change\
    \ of blood velocity and\nfat fraction in Figure 2 b). Furthermore, the development\
    \ of a liver tumor\ncan be calculated dependent on nutrients, see Figure 2 c).\
    \ The kinetics of tumor development follows the Monod kinetics, whereby glucose\
    \ is\nconsumed during the process.\nTo investigate the dependence of microscopic\
    \ perfusion on the geometry\nof liver lobules, the locations of central veins\
    \ and portal triads from histological sections are identified, meshed and used\
    \ as input of the simulation. The resulting pressure distribution shown in Figure\
    \ 3 b) thus allows\nfor a real velocity distribution.\nThe calculation of steatotic\
    \ livers requires identification and quantification of the existing fat content.\
    \ Therefore, a convolutional neural network\n(CNN) was trained on previously manually\
    \ annotated fat content in histological images [3], see Figure 4.\nThe coupled\
    \ multiphasic model enables the simulation of the complex\nhepatic deformation-function-perfusion\

  abstract: "Synopsis:\nAttaining reproducible, time-efficient, high spatial resolution\
    \ and quantitative MRI perfusion images in small animal MRI @9.4T is still challenging.\
    \ To take a step toward this goal, perfusion data from arterial spin labeling\
    \ (ASL), Flow-sensitive Alternating Inversion Recovery (FAIR), dynamic susceptibility\
    \ contrast (DSC), and pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) sequences\
    \ are compared by assessing cerebral perfusion in 5 rats, each scanned 3 times.\
    \ Differences in CBF in major brain regions were analyzed, and the repeatability\
    \ of perfusion MRI was assessed. \n\n\nIntroduction:\nPerfusion MRI is widely\
    \ used clinically to evaluate cerebral perfusion in numerous neurological disorders\xB9\
    . However, cerebral perfusion of small rodents on ultra-high-field scanners is\
    \ much less established, and although most methods such as pCASL\xB2, FAIR\xB3\
    , or contrast agent-based DSC\xB3 have been implemented on small animal MRIs,\
    \ there are few evaluations of existing methods in rodents \xB2\u207B\u2074. This\
    \ work compares cerebral blood flow (CBF) obtained with pCASL, FAIR, and DSC in\
    \ a group of 5 healthy rats in 3 repetitions to evaluate systematic differences\
    \ between the techniques as well as their individual reproducibility. \n\nMethods:\
    \ \nAnimals: 5 adult Wistar rats were scanned on 3 separate days. Rats were pre-anesthetized\
    \ with a bolus injection followed by a continuous infusion of Medetomidine in\
    \ combination with 0.5% isoflurane to minimize the vasodilative effects of isoflurane.\
    \ Respiration was maintained at 75 bpm\xB110bpm, and rectal temperature was 36.5\xB1\
    0.5\xB0C at baseline and increased to 38.5\xB10.5\xB0C during the course of the\
    \ examination due to the high SAR of the pCASL sequence. All scans were performed\
    \ on a 9.4T Bruker BioSpec MRI system with a 4 channel-head array. \nAcquisition\
    \ Protocol: pCASL acquisition followed published protocols\xB2 including calibration\
    \ scans. pCASL and FAIR used the same spin-echo EPI: matrix 96x96 with partial\
    \ Fourier 1.5, bandwidth of 300kHz, and spatial resolution of (0.22x0.22x1) mm3.\
    \ The pCASL specific parameters were TE=16ms, TR=4000ms, labeling duration 3000ms,\
    \ 60 repetitions, and TA=8min. The FAIR specific parameters were TE=13.6ms, TR=10000ms,\
    \  2 averages, 16 different inversion times each for global and selective inversion,\
    \ and TA=11min.\nFor the DSC acquisition, a matrix of 90x56 with partial Fourier\
    \ of 1.2, resolution (0.26x0.26x1) mm3, TE=9.46ms, TR=150ms, BW 300kHz, 800 repetitions,\
    \ and TA 2min was used.  A bolus of 1ml/kg of 1:5 diluted Gd-DTPA was administered\
    \ via the lateral tail vein after 25s with a bolus length of 2s and flushed with\
    \ saline.  \nPost-processing: For pCASL, the measured inversion efficiency and\
    \ a T1map were used for calibration. FAIR perfusion maps were calculated using\
    \ Bruker Paravision 6, and pCASL evaluation was performed in Matlab\xB2. For DSC\
    \ the cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps were calculated via deconvolution with an\
    \ arterial input function.\nRegions of interest (ROI) were manually drawn in Freeview5\
    \ (see Fig 1a) for each rat and repeat scan and separately for DSC and ASL. DSC-based\
    \ CBF maps represent relative CBF values in arbitrary units, ASL CBF values are\
    \ quantitative. \n\nResults: \nFig. 1b-d show example parameter maps for DSC,\
    \ pCASL, and FAIR. The pCASL sequence yields lower noise in the derived CBF maps\
    \ compared with FAIR, and the visual perfusion contrast between the tissues is\
    \ best in the pCASL-CBF maps. \nThe cumulative distribution (eCDF) of the perfusion\
    \ values in each ROI is shown in Fig. 2. The eCDF shows the value range and distribution\
    \ of the different methods and how well the ROI-areas are separated with respect\
    \ to perfusion. The distributions obtained with pCASL and FAIR are in fair  agreement\
    \ and show CBF increasing from white matter and hippocampus followed by cortex\
    \ and thalamus. This ranking is, however, changed in the data obtained from DSC,\
    \ where the hippocampus shows the lowest perfusion of the 4 ROIs. \nFigure 3 examines\
    \ the CBF correlation of pCASL with FAIR and DSC, comparing the median CBF value\
    \ in each ROI in each animal. In general, CBF was most highly correlated for pCASL\
    \ and FAIR (Spearman\u2019s r = 0.63 across all animals, compared to r = 0.42\
    \ for pCASL vs DSC). \nFigure 4 compares the relative agreement between pCASL\
    \ and FAIR and pCASL and DSC using Bland-Altman plots. FAIR and pCASL agree well\
    \ across the range of values, but white matter shows much less variation than\
    \ the other tissues, particularly thalamus and cortex. The lower plot comparing\
    \ DSC-CBF and pCASL again shows the deviating behavior of white matter with higher\
    \ apparent perfusion in the DSC-based values. \nFigure 5 analyses the 3 re-scans\
    \ of each animal using boxplots with outliers. The FAIR plot (c) has a very wide\
    \ distribution and many outliers to the right (some even cut off). DSC-CBF is\
    \ scaled differently and therefore difficult to compare directly, but the distributions\
    \ are narrow compared with the differences between ROIs. \n\n\nDiscussion: \n\
    All three perfusion MRI methods presented provided CBF maps of rat brains, but\
    \ their comparison did not result in a clear winner. While FAIR shows noisier\
    \ CBF maps and the distinction between the tissue types is less clear, the method\
    \ is robust and easy to use. pCASL causes significant SAR heating and requires\
    \ multiple calibration scans2 to achieve accurate results. This requires practice\
    \ and a smooth workflow, possibly also indicated by the lower perfusion values\
    \ in Fig. 5b for the first repetition.  The presented DSC-CBF maps currently do\
    \ not provide absolute quantitative values, but this may be possible in future\
    \ studies. The time resolution of 150ms was sufficient to extract arterial input\
    \ functions for deconvolution. However, in the DSC-CBF maps, the low-perfused\
    \ white matter showed higher perfusion than hippocampus, although ASL did. Although\
    \ this may be a known issue with FAIR3, the effect was quite strong in our data\
    \ and hence requires further, more detailed investigation.\n\nSummary: \nThe ideal\
    \ MRI perfusion sequence is dependent on the pre-clinical question. In rats, pCASL\
    \ and DSC are more suitable for reproducibility of CBF but do not entirely agree,\
    \ whereas FAIR is noisier but easier to use."

  title: 'Fast 3D Isotropic High-Resolution MRI of Mouse Brain Using a Variable Flip
    Angle RARE

    Sequence With T2 Compensation @9.4T'
  authors: Herrman KH , Hung LY, and Reichenbach JR
  abstract: "Synopsis\nSome applications require T2-weighted mouse brain MRI with\
    \ isotropic high resolution (100\xB5m3), but at 9.4T the short T2 of mouse brain\
    \ limits the echo train length of RARE sequences and exacerbates T2-decay artifacts.\
    \ Adapting a RARE sequence by using variable \uFB02ip-angles allows a reduction\
    \ in scan time from 19min to 7-9min with similar image quality. However, long\
    \ RARE echo trains and strong imaging gradients can unintentionally cause substantial\
    \ di\uFB00usion weighting. To minimize the di\uFB00usion e\uFB00ects crusher gradients\
    \ were optimized and the variable \uFB02ip angles were kept above 40\xB0.\n\n\
    Introduction\nWe aim to achieve artifact-free, isotropic high-resolution images\
    \ of the mouse brain for neurological applications1. While 9.4T renders T1-based\
    \ grey-white-matter contrast mostly useless, T2-weighted images achieve excellent\
    \ anatomical contrast and can be e\uFB03ciently acquired by 2D-RARE sequences.\
    \ However, 2D acquisitions limit the achievable isotropic resolution due to minimal\
    \ slice thickness and SAR. Using 3D acquisitions increases the acquisition time\
    \ (TA), particularly since at 9.4T the short T2 of brain tissue limits echo train\
    \ length with standard 180\xB0 refocusing pulses. The use of refocusing pulses\
    \ with constant reduced \uFB02ip angles was shown2 to prolong the echo train to\
    \ facilitate anatomic mouse brain scans within 20-40min.\nOur aim here was to\
    \ reduce the acquisition time for T2w-3D-RARE by applying variable \uFB02ip angles\
    \ (VFAs) to shape the echoes' signal envelope3,4 while preserving the image quality.\n\
    \nMaterial & Methods\nAll data were acquired on a Bruker BioSpec 94/20USR with\
    \ 660mT/m gradients using a helium-cooled 2-channel transceiver quadrature surface\
    \ coil (CryoProbe, Bruker Biopsin, Ettlingen). All mice were scanned in vivo under\
    \ Iso\uFB02urane anesthesia.\nThe proposed varFlipRARE sequence uses three initialization\
    \ RF pulses4 to drive the magnetization into a pseudo-steady-state matching the\n\
    target FA<<90\xB0. Subsequently, three acquisition phases can be adjusted separately,\
    \ each allowing for a linear transition from one FA to another within a given\
    \ number of echoes (Figure 3). Typically, the \uFB01rst phase comprised the \uFB01\
    rst 1/3 of echoes, repeating the target FA or slightly increasing it. In the second\
    \ phase, the FA increased to ~90\xB0 over 1/2 of the total echoes, followed by\
    \ the last phase, which ramped the FA up to 160-180\xB0. Usually, k0 was acquired\
    \ at the center of the echo train.\nThe general scan parameters for all varFlipRARE\
    \ acquisitions were TA=7min 15s, TR=2200ms, isotropic resolution 100\xB5m3, \u0394\
    TE=2.45ms,\nTF=70, BW=150kHz. The excitation and refocusing pulses were non-selective\
    \ hard pulses with duration 128\xB5s (exc) and 80\xB5s (rfc) corresponding to\
    \ 10kHz bandwidth to minimize echo spacing. The phase encoding gradients were\
    \ 430\xB5s long and the read and slice crusher gradients were played out during\
    \ the same time frame at 10% (approx. 66mT/m).\nTo explore further possibilities\
    \ of applying VFAs, a faster sequence with RARE factor TF=140 with TA=4min was\
    \ used, setting the target FA to 30-35\xB0, following similar VFA increase patterns\
    \ as stated above. The second variation aimed to increase the resolution to 76\xB5\
    m3 with TF=86 and TA=24min, \u0394TE=3ms, TR=2700ms, and 2 averages.\nFor reference,\
    \ a RARE acquisition2 with slab-selective 90\xB0 excitation and 125\xB0 refocusing\
    \ RF pulses was used with TA=19min, TR=1600ms,\nisotropic resolution 100\xB5m3,\
    \ \u0394TE=5ms, TF=20, BW=150kHz.\nAll sequences used full Nyquist sampling of\
    \ the 18x14x10mm3 FoV and were acquired in coronal orientation, i.e. read out\
    \ head-feet, phase left-right, and slice ventral-dorsal direction. All shown images\
    \ were reconstructed with T2-compensation and Gibbs-ringing-\uFB01lter for basic\
    \ artifact reduction2. SNR and CNR values were calculated from the mean signal\
    \ in ROIs and the standard deviation in artifact-free background areas.\n\nResults\n\
    Figure 1 presents the reference image (a) and images acquired with the faster\
    \ varFlipRARE sequence (b-i) for di\uFB00erent FA schemes. With a low target FA=30\xB0\
    \ (h, i) a distinctly lower signal for the ventricles(Vs) was observed. For a\
    \ higher target, FA\u224840\xB0 (f) or when k0 was shifted to 120ms (FA\u2248\
    35\xB0, e) the T2- and ventricle-contrast was improved. The contrast could be\
    \ further enhanced by immediately ramping up to ~50\xB0 from the target FA\u2248\
    40\xB0 (c,d) in the \uFB01rst phase. To further improve ventricle signal TR was\
    \ increased to 2700ms (TA=9min, b). The SNR grey matter (GM)=35, white matter(WM)=27,\
    \ V=51 and CNR CGM-WM=9, CV-GW=15, CV-WM=24 in Fig 1b and c both match the reference\
    \ image in GM and WM, the ventricle contrast is 15-20% lower. The signal envelope\
    \ along the echo train is given below each MR image for the 2 channels of the\
    \ CryoProbe, providing more insights into the actual signal behavior.\nTo assess\
    \ the e\uFB00ect of the crusher gradients in read and slice direction Figure 2\
    \ shows an image comparison. In 2b) no crusher was used at all, leading to some\
    \ ripple artifacts in the frontal olfactory bulb. Increasing the slice-crusher\
    \ to 10% amplitude doesn't create a visual di\uFB00erence.\nIncreasing the read-crusher\
    \ to 10% removes the ripple artifacts, but at 20% the frontal bulbous and ventricles\
    \ lose signal.\nFigure 2e-f shows the resulting images using TF=140. The low ventricle\
    \ contrast in e) was improved by a faster increase of the target FA (f). The higher\
    \ resolution scans with 76\xB5m are shown in Figure 2g-h.\n\nDiscussion \nThe\
    \ use of VFAs together with faster non-selective acquisitions reduced the scan\
    \ time from 19min to 7-9min achieving similar image contrast and quality as the\
    \ reference. Reducing the scan time further to TA=4min leads to SNR below 10 due\
    \ to unintentional di\uFB00usion weighting as has been described before5. Simulations5\
    \ showed that the use of FAs lower than 40\xB0 strongly enhances the e\uFB00ective\
    \ b-value and 99% of the\nb-contribution arises from the readout gradients, leading\
    \ to water-signal suppression. Increasing the read crushers to remove artifacts\
    \ will further increase the di\uFB00usion weighting and has to be carefully chosen.\n\
    \nSummary \nIn summary, variable \uFB02ip angles enable faster 3D RARE acquisitions\
    \ without compromising image quality, and even resolutions of isotropic 76\xB5\
    m3 are feasible in less than 30min with rich anatomic details."

  title: Computational Modeling for Liver Surgery and Interventions
  authors: Bruno Christ, Uta Dahmen, Nicole Radde, Tim Ricken
  abstract: 'In the context of severe liver diseases, the prediction of the treatment
    outcome mainly relies on observational clinical data reflecting liver function
    as a whole at best. These, however, are impacted by the individual situation of
    the patient comprising age, gender, comorbidities, pre-treatment medication, and
    general physical conditions. In hepatology and gastroenterology disciplines, algorithms
    have been developed to grade acute liver failure emerging on the ground of chronic
    diseases like cirrhosis. However, in liver surgery, a reliable risk assessment
    for postoperative liver failure, a severe complication with often fatal consequences
    for the patient, is still lacking. Yet, to improve the therapeutic and/or surgical
    outcome of patients suffering from liver diseases, both in internal medicine and
    surgery disciplines, concrete guidelines based on reliable clinical data and predictive
    algorithms are urgently needed.


    The liver represents a multiscale network comprising three levels: organ, lobe,
    and cell level. In addition, hepatic functions are distributed heterogeneously
    throughout the parenchyma, rendering the hepatocytes surrounding the portal tracts
    to execute, e.g., ammonia fixation by ureagenesis, and hepatocytes surrounding
    the hepatic vein to fix ammonia via the glutamine synthetase reaction. Thus, multiscale
    models describing liver function may unequivocally help to design predictive tools
    for assessing the surgical risk and the probability of therapeutic success.

    Recent developments of computational models make it possible to describe organ
    functions on different scales. It is the goal of this Research Topic, to collect
    papers involving cutting-edge approaches of multiscale computational modeling
    in the context of liver surgery and interventions. We invite authors to send their
    latest and highly innovative research or comprehensive review articles related
    to the scope of this Research Topic.


    To predict post-treatment liver function before surgical, radiological, or pharmacological
    interventions is the most challenging task for clinicians when treating severe
    liver diseases. Based on the individual unique situation of the patient, novel
    therapy concepts are warranted in order to stratify therapy outcome. In order
    to open the perspective for the development of predictive tools anticipating liver
    function post-treatment, we invite submissions entailing computational approaches
    of liver modeling or methodology for a data-based patient-specific risk assessment
    in the context of liver surgery and interventions. Research should address, but
    is not restricted to modeling and data-based analysis of hepatic metabolism, liver
    perfusion, regeneration, and communication with other organs. Research dealing
    with multiscale modeling is specifically encouraged. We also greatly appreciate
    research comprising machine learning/artificial intelligence methods including
    knowledge-driven approaches and consideration of uncertainty.'

  title: "Frontiers Research Topic \u201CMultiscale Modeling for the Liver\u201D"
  authors: Ho H, Rezaina V, Schwen LO
  abstract: 'The liver is the central metabolic organ in the mammalian body. Numerous
    in silico models have been constructed to simulate liver functions such as circulation,
    drug transport, metabolism, and clearance at the organism, organ, lobular, cellular,
    and molecular levels. Adding to the complexity of the spatial dimension are the
    vastly different temporal scales: from the membrane transport of drug molecules
    within milliseconds to viral infection of liver tissues in days or months. In
    recent years there has been a growing trend in the liver modeling community to
    integrate models at different spatial and temporal scales. For example, a model
    for the transport of drugs in sinusoids could be coupled with metabolic kinetics
    models in hepatocytes, whilst incorporating the heterogeneous distribution of
    metabolic enzymes and transporters along the metabolic zones in liver lobules.
    Multiscale liver modeling will benefit from recent developments in Systems Biology
    and/or Systems Medicine.


    This Research Topic is to provide a venue for showcasing the concepts, methodology,
    experimental data, and computational tools associated with multiscale liver modeling.
    The main challenge in multiscale modeling is to bridge models at different scales.
    For example, surgical intervention drastically changes perfusion at the organism
    level, leading to elevated shear stress at the sinusoidal level, which in turn
    stimulates liver regeneration. Liver diseases progressing over the course of months
    affect clearance processes at the time scale of hours. Toxic liver injury occurs
    at the cellular level but affects the circulation of metabolites at the organism
    level. In addition to models spanning the different scales, integrating cellular
    and molecular level models and experimental data are the very core of multiscale
    liver modeling.


    The contributions to the Research Topic include Original Research papers, (Mini)
    Reviews, and Opinions on liver modeling. The specific topics include:


    - Blood flow models for large hepatic vessels and/or sinusoids;

    - Liver tissue models and virtual lobule models;

    - Imaging and image analysis techniques for revealing microstructure and processes
    at multiple scales;

    - Mechanistic factors underlying liver diseases (e.g., steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis,
    cancer)


    Projects at the interface of Biomechanics and Computational Biology can also be
    considered, including:

    - Drug uptake, metabolism, and clearance models;

    - Numerical/mathematical methods for bridging models at different temporal and
    spatial scales;

    - Application of Systems Biology and Physiome to multiscale liver modeling.'

  title: A Multiscale and Multiphase, Data- and Knowledge-Driven Simulation of Function-Perfusion
    Processes in the Human Liver
  authors: "Lena Lambers, Steffen Gerh\xE4usser, Luis Mandl, Andr\xE9 Mielke, Tim\
    \ Ricken"
  abstract: Modeling active biological systems, such as the human liver, with a complex
    interaction between cellular metabolism and perfusion in the functional units,
    requires a multiscale and multiphase approach to the tissue. Changes in hepatic
    perfusion and tissue morphol-ogy induced by surgical interventions or liver disease,
    directly influence the coupled liver function [1]. To better understand the interplay
    between hepatic perfusion, metabolism and tissue in the hierarchically organized
    liver structure, we have developed a multicom-ponent, poro-elastic multiphase
    and multiscale function-perfusion model, cf. [2], using a multicomponent mixture
    theory based on the Theory of Porous Media (TPM, see [3]). The multiscale approach
    considers the different functional units of the liver, the so-called liver lobules,
    with an anisotropic blood flow, and the hepatocytes, where the biochemical metabolic
    reactions take place. On the lobular scale, we assume a homogenized tetra-phasic
    mixture body, composed of a porous solid structure representing healthy tissue,
    a liquid phase describing the blood, and two solid phases with the ability of
    growth and depletion representing the fat and the tumor tissue. The phases consist
    of a carrier phase, called solvent, and solutes, representing microscopic components
    dissolved in the solvent. To describe the metabolic processes in the cells, the
    describing PDEs on the lobule scale are coupled with ODEs on the cell scale, resulting
    in a bi-scale PDE-ODE approach. To enable patient-specific simulations and increase
    the robustness of the model, data-driven approaches will be implemented for computationally
    critical parts of the model. We use experimental, clinical and in silico data
    such as stained histological liver sec-tions, perfusion measures or imaging data
    [4] for parametrization and validation of the multiphase model. The overarching
    goal is to define and develop an accurate decision-supporting framework for clinical
    applications.

  title: Data- and Knowledge-Driven Multiphase and Multiscale Simulation of Growth
    and Remodeling Processes in the Human Liver
  authors: "Lena Lambers, Steffen Gerh\xE4usser, Luis Mandl, Andr\xE9 Mielke, Tim\
    \ Ricken"
  abstract: As a central organ for metabolic processes in the human body, the liver
    has a complex perfusion-function relationship defined by microcirculation through
    the capillaries coupled to function processes in liver cells. Numerical multiscale
    simulations can describe this relation and thus support the diagnosis as well
    as the prediction of hepatic diseases [1]. Surgical interventions and the development
    of various liver diseases lead to growth and remodeling processes in liver tissue
    as well as changes of the perfusion, which directly affects the coupled liver
    function [2]. To better understand the interplay between hepatic perfusion, metabolism
    and tissue in the hierarchically organized liver structure, we have developed
    a multicomponent, poro-elastic multiphasic and multiscale function-perfusion model,
    cf. [3], using a mul-ticomponent mixture theory based on the Theory of Porous
    Media (TPM, see [4]). The multiscale ap-proach considers the different functional
    units of the liver, the so-called liver lobules, with an anisotropic blood flow,
    and the hepatocytes, where the biochemical metabolic reactions take place. On
    the lobular scale, we assume a homogenized tetra-phasic mixture body, composed
    of a porous solid structure rep-resenting healthy tissue, a liquid phase describing
    the blood, and two solid phases with the ability of growth and depletion representing
    the fat tissue and the tumor tissue. The phases consist of a carrier phase, called
    solvent, and solutes, representing microscopic components, e.g. nutrients, dissolved
    in the solvent. To describe the metabolic processes as well as the production,
    utilization and storage of the metabolites in the cells, the describing PDEs on
    the lobule scale are coupled with ODEs on the cell scale resulting in a bi-scale
    PDE-ODE approach. To increase the robustness of the model and allow for near real-time
    patient-specific simulations, com-putationally critical parts of the model are
    enhanced by data-driven methods through the integration of experimental, clinical
    and in silico data, such as the zonated quantification of steatosis or the realistic
    geometry of the liver lobules by image segmentation from stained histological
    liver sections. The over-arching goal is the definition and development of an
    accurate decision-supporting framework for clinical applications.

  title: A physiologically based model of pravastatin - The role of genotypes and
    hepatic or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin
  authors: "Helen Leal Pujol, Matthias K\xF6nig"
  abstract: Hypercholesterolaemia, i.e., elevated plasma levels of cholesterol, is
    a major risk factor for cardio- vascular disease, the leading cause of death globally.
    Hypercholesterolaemia can be treated using statins, a class of medications which
    inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, a major enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. Pravastatin
    is a statin used to reduce total and low-density plasma cholesterol levels and
    increase high-density plasma cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolaemic patients.
    Pravastatin is absorbed from the small intestine by the transporter OATP2B1 and
    subsequently transported in the liver via OATP1B1 from where it can be exported
    in the bile via the enzymatic exporter MRP2. Pravastatin can be excreted either
    in the urine via the kidneys or in the faeces due to incomplete absorption. Hepatic
    and renal impairment could have a large impact on the pharmacokinetics of statins
    as could have genetic variants of the transporters OATP2B1, OATP1B1 and MRP2.
    Within this thesis the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin were analysed by developing
    a physio- logically-based pharmacokinetics model based on extensive data curation
    of pravastatin data. The model allows to simulate the time-concentration courses
    of pravastatin in various tissues and to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters
    for pravastatin. Furthermore, the model was applied to investigate the effects
    of genotypes of the enzymatic transporters and hepatic and renal im- pairment
    on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin. Thus, key questions such as, how pravastatin
    therapy would be affected in renal or hepatic disease, as well as how pravastatin
    therapy should be adapted based on genotypes, find an answer in this work.

  title: F.A.I.R. Workflows for Bayesian Inference in Systems Medicine
  authors: "H\xF6pfl Sebastian, Radde Nicole E."
  abstract: 'Modelling is becoming increasingly essential to gain insights into biomedical
    systems, resulting in a large number of published models, data and results. A
    problem is that some of these are not available or can only be reproduced with
    a great deal of effort. However, this is essential as model predictions must be
    reliable and models should be easily expandable in a fast-moving field like systems
    medicine. This rises the need for comprehensive F.A.I.R. workflows.

    Especially Bayesian workflows, which provide a comprehensive description of uncertainties
    for all quantities of a model, produce a lot of data and need proper documentation
    to be reproducible. In particular, prior distributions must be specified and documented
    and the whole posterior should be reported (van de Schoot et al. 2021). Visualizations
    of the convergence and statistical tests which complement the analysis can also
    help others to understand the work. From a practitioners viewpoint, we aim to
    establish F.A.I.R. workflows that are build on existing standards particularly
    in a Bayesian learning context, thus simplifying and promoting reproducible work.
    Therefore, we combine the PEtab format, a format that contains an SBML model and
    the complete parameter estimation problem, with all information of our Bayesian
    analysis. Furthermore, visualizations that promote understanding are added and
    uploaded in a FAIRDOMHub project that can be accessed via a DOI. This helps biologists
    and clinicians to understand our work and promotes further research as other computational
    scientists can easily extend our models and make further analyses.'

  abstract: "Hintergrund/Zielsetzung \nEine Leberteilresektion ist oft die einzig\

  title: Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for metabolic phenotyping
    and evaluation of liver function
  authors: "K\xF6nig M, Grzegorzewski J"
  abstract: 'Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) are digital twins
    of human physiology which allow the study of individual drug metabolism in silico.
    PBPK models can simulate the absorption, distribution, metabolization and elimination
    of substances and when coupled to pharmacodynamics models also the effect of the
    substance on the body.


    Here we present our work on PBPK models for metabolic phenotyping and evaluation
    of liver function [1-5]. For the development and validation we established the
    first open pharmacokinetics database PB-PK with data from over 600 curated clinical
    studies [1]. The database allows to integrate data for given test substances and
    study the effect of lifestyle factors or co-administration such as smoking or
    oral contraceptives [2]. Based on the curated data individualized and stratified
    computational models have been established and applied to various clinical questions
    [3-5]. A model of indocyanine green allowed to simulate individual outcome after
    hepatectomy by building patient-specific models using data such as anthropometric
    information (e.g. sex, weight, age) and pre-existing liver disease [3]. Combining
    the data with information on study cohorts allowed to simulate virtual populations
    [4]. Using a model of dextromethorphan coupled to drug-gene interactions accounting
    for changes in CYP2D6 enzyme kinetics depending on activity score (AS), allowed
    in combination with AS for individual polymorphisms to study the effect of CYP2D6
    gene variants [5]. The model was applied to investigate the genotype-phenotype
    association and the role of CYP2D6 polymorphisms for metabolic phenotyping using
    the urinary cumulative metabolic ratio (UCMR). The model is capable of estimating
    the UCMR dispersion within and across populations depending on activity scores.
    The model can be applied for individual prediction of UCMR and metabolic phenotype
    based on CYP2D6 genotype. A model of omeprazole allowed to study the effect of
    omeprazole therapy on stomach pH, a model of simvastatin to study the LDL-C lowering
    effect of statins, and a model of pravastatin the effect of genetic variants and
    hepato-renal impairment on pravastatin pharmacokinetics. All models and data are
    available for reuse with models encoded in SBML.


    We end the talk with an outlook on how such PBPK models can be applied to predict
    liver function in liver cancer and how coupling of such models to AI could help
    in clinical decision support.

  title: Bayesian hypothesis testing reveals that reproducible models in Systems Biology
    get more citations
  authors: "Sebastian H\xF6pfl, J\xFCrgen Pleiss, Nicole E. Radde"
  abstract: Many measures have been taken to develop data and modeling standards towards
    a F.A.I.R. data and model management by the Systems Biology community. Still,
    there is an ongoing debate about incentives and merits for the individual researcher
    to make their research results reproducible. Here, we pose the specific question
    whether reproducible models have higher impact in terms of citations. Therefore,
    we statistically analyze 328 published models which were recently classified by
    Tiwari et al. based on their reproducibility. For hypotheses testing, we use a
    flexible Bayesian approach that provides full distributional information for all
    quantities of interest and can handle outliers. The results show that in the period
    from 2013, i.e. 10 years after the introduction of SBML, to 2020, the group of
    reproducible models is significantly more cited than the non-reproducible group.
    We show that this effect is not explained by differences in journal impact factors
    and that it increases with additional standardization of data and error model
    integration via PEtab. Overall, our statistical analysis demonstrates long-term
    merits of reproducible modeling for the individual researcher in terms of citations.
    Moreover, it provides evidences for an increased use of reproducible models in
    the scientific community.

  authors: "Matthias K\xF6nig"
  abstract: The liver is the main organ involved in the clearance of most drugs, e.g.,
    acetaminophen. The function of the liver can be evaluated using information about
    the clearance of test drugs (pharmacokinetics data) in combination with computational
    models describing the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME)
    of these substances in the human body. Within this lab project a physiologically
    based model of the elimination of an example drug in the human body will be established
    based on existing literature data. Such a model allows us to simulate in silico
    the pharmacokinetics of the example drugs and evaluate hypotheses, for instance,
    on drug-drug interactions or alterations in drug metabolism in disease or with
    age. The project will focus on acetylsalicylic acid or omeprazole (but other drugs
    could be used). The project is a computational project requiring basic programming
    skills, no wet lab work will be performed.

  title: Modeling of function-perfusion interaction in the human liver based on a
    multiscale porous media model
  authors: "Steffen Gerh\xE4usser, Tim Ricken, Lena Lambers, Luis Mandl, Matthias\
    \ K\xF6nig"
  abstract: The liver is the central organ of metabolic homeostasis in the whole body
    and and is the first line for the detoxification of drugs and toxins. Due to our
    diet and lifestyle choices, liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
    (NAFLD) or liver cancer are among the most common diseases in industrial countries.
    In the context of clinical treatment, digital models offer an enormous potential
    to assess the risk of surgical intervention in liver resections [1]. Here we present
    a multiscale mathematical model based on the coupling of the tissue and the cellular
    scale. Within a continuum biomechanical approach the hepatic lobule can be modeled
    as a multiphasic, porous solid body saturated with blood using a multicomponent
    mixture theory based on the Theory of Porous Media (TPM, see [2]). The deformation,
    blood flow and transport processes within the lobule are modeled using a system
    of coupled partial differential equations (PDE). Microscopic components like nutrients
    or xenobiotics are represented as solutes solved in the carrier phase (blood),
    which are transported through the lobule domain by advection and diffusion. On
    the cell scale underneath, metabolic processes take place in the form of chemical
    reaction networks influencing the local concentration of the solutes. Those processes
    are modelled using a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODE).
    In the context of a systems biology approach, the elimination rate of the contaminant
    within the cell is depends on many factors, such as the zonation of CYP2E1 or
    the necrosis state of the cell. In our PDE-ODE approach the cell model is embedded
    in every integration point of the finite element providing source/sink terms for
    the balance equations of the macro model. Using a one-way coupling scheme, the
    macro model provides the solute concentration and the volume fractions for the
    cell model. A peculiarity of the coupling is the integration of domain specific
    solvers, combining a software tool for finite element analysis with a software
    library for high-performance simulation of Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)
    based models. The described model is used to simulate paracetamol degradation
    as a showcase for the liver function. In addition, the coupling of the multiscale
    lobule model to an ODE-based physiological-based pharmacokinetics models on the
    whole body scale is also addressed. The developed model can pave the way to simulate
    patient-specific data and ultimately drive the development of an accurate decision-supporting
    framework for everyday clinical use.

  title: SIMulation supported LIVer Assessment for donor organs (SimLivA) - Continuum-biomechanical
    modeling for staging of ischemia reperfusion injury during liver transplantation
  authors: "Professorin Dr. Uta Dahmen, Professor Dr.-Ing. Tim Ricken, Privatdozent\
    \ Dr. Hans-Michael Tautenhahn, Dr. Matthias K\xF6nig"
  abstract: "Background: Liver transplantation (LTx) is the only curative treatment\
    \ option for acute and chronic end-stage liver disease. Demographic change and\
    \ western lifestyle result in an increasing rate of elderly multi-morbid potential\
    \ recipients and donors. Liver grafts from such donors, so-called marginal liver\
    \ grafts, are often affected by hepatic steatosis compromising the quality of\
    \ the donor organ substantially. One reason is the alteration of the tissue structure,\
    \ resulting in an impaired perfusion, which in turn affects hepatic metabolism\
    \ and organ function. In case of a marginal graft, the surgeon is faced with the\
    \ clinical decision to either accept or reject the organ, significantly increasing\
    \ the postoperative risk for the recipient or increasing the risk of death on\
    \ the waiting list, respectively. Two major challenges for marginal grafts are\
    \ the storage between procurement of the organ and transplantation (cold ischemia\
    \ time) and damage after reperfusion (ischemia reperfusion injury or IRI).Goal:\
    \ Our co-designed interdisciplinary project \u201CSIMulation supported LIVer Assessment\
    \ for donor organs (SimLivA)\u201D aims to mathematically model the impact of\
    \ mechanical alterations of the (steatotic) marginal liver graft and cold ischemia\
    \ on early IRI. We address the following research questions: (i) How to co-design\
    \ computational methods, experimental studies, clinical processes, and technical\
    \ workflows? (ii) How to improve the multiscale continuum-biomechanical model\
    \ for prediction of IRI? (iii) How to obtain experimental and clinical data that\
    \ are essential to quantify the relationship between steatosis, ischemia and reperfusion\
    \ injury? (iv) How to evaluate the clinical usability of the model?Methods: To\
    \ achieve these goals, we will extend and adapt our coupled continuum-biomechanical\
    \ multiphase and multi-scale PDE-ODE model of the liver lobule to numerically\
    \ simulate IRI in dependence of the degree of steatosis and ischemia duration.\
    \ Experimental and clinical data acquisition for model parameterization and validation\
    \ is designed in close collaboration with modeling. A proof-of-concept trial for\
    \ clinical applicability will be performed. Our model couples structure, perfusion\
    \ and function of the liver via the interplay between mechanical properties of\
    \ the graft, hepatic sinusoidal perfusion and the affected molecular pathways,\
    \ which might facilitate these decision processes and is urgently needed. This\
    \ will be the first step towards an in-silico clinical decision support tool to\
    \ reach a better decision pro or contra the marginal organ by in-silico predicting\
    \ hepatic damage and early graft function."

    human liver using preCICE
  authors: "Fritz Otlinghaus, Steffen Gerh\xE4usser, Ishaan Desai, Tim Ricken, Benjamin\
    \ Uekermann"
  abstract: 'As the human liver is one of the most important organs in the human body,
    the scientific community aims to improve our understanding of its internal processes
    to enable better planning for individual liver surgeries. This includes the complex
    relationship between hepatic tissue and metabolic cell processes.

    This work is based on the modeling approach proposed by [RWH+14] where the hepatic
    tissue is modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs) in a homogenization
    approach based on the extended Theory of Porous Media (eTPM). These equations
    are then coupled with ordinary differential equations (ODEs), representing the
    metabolic processes in the liver cells. These models are solved by the FEM-solver
    FEBio for the hepatic tissue, and the ODEs on the cell scale are solved by the
    biochemical software library libRoadRunner.

    This work introduces a new two scale coupling using the coupling library preCICE
    and the Micro Manager. A new FEBio-preCICE adapter is implemented and compared
    to an existing coupling. To evaluate the differences in the couplings, three test
    cases are defined and simulation time, quality and memory usage for each test
    case is compared. This is followed up by discussing and comparing advantages and
    disadvantages for each coupling.'

  abstract: 'Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Diagnosis
    and treatment are time-critical and require highly patient-specific diagnostic
    and treatment pathways. Medical decision-making is based on a multitude of interdependent
    factors related to various medical disciplines, past experiences and clinical
    guidelines. The consideration of all decision factors in combination with the
    possible therapy approaches is a major challenge for the physicians and often
    cannot be solved in an optimal way even in the interdisciplinary tumor board.
    In this project, we develop ATLAS, a decision support tool, which will significantly
    assist clinicians with this challenge. Based on AI methods, ATLAS processes all
    relevant patient data from databases, systems medicine and continuum biomechanical
    in silico prognoses modeling data as well as individual patient data. The tool
    will be developed in a co-design approach by experts in surgical oncology, mathematical
    modeling, and machine learning.

    Chosen technologies integrate the automated understanding of a highly complex
    patient situation through the simulation of liver functions with expert knowledge
    and ontology-guided learning with knowledge graphs from retrospective cases of
    liver tumors.

    ATLAS will be based on detailed historical data cohort from over 6,000 patients
    with liver tumors and will be evaluated on case studies at the Jena University
    Hospital. The integration of medical expert knowledge, mathematical modeling and
    artificial intelligence constitutes a highly original and most promising approach
    for high-quality diagnoses and treatments of liver tumors resulting in patient-specific
    prognosis improvement.

    Scientific insights from this projects will offer exploitation possibilities for
    the transfer to malignancies in other organs, such as lungs, kidneys or the brain.

    Tool and demonstrator development will provide for sustainable exploitation pathways

  title: Asymmetric echo variable flip angle RARE for n-echo Dixon based PDFF @ 9.4T
  authors: Zhao WT, Herrmann KH, Sibgatulin R, Arlt J, Wei WW, Dahmen U, and Reichenbach
    JR.
  abstract: "Introduction\nConventional fat fraction quantification relies on gradient\
    \ echo based sequences1-4, which has the advantage of fast acquisition, while\
    \ being vulnerable to motion and susceptibility artifacts. At 9.4T not only the\
    \ susceptibility artifacts are much stronger, but also the echo time of a FLASH\
    \ sequence can\u2019t resolve the in-phase to opposed-phase progression which\
    \ corresponds to an echo time difference of 0.357 ms. Additionally, at such high\
    \ field, a spin- echo based sequence has the benefit to suppress R2* effects while\
    \ echo shifting can be used to sample the spin echo asymmetrically at arbitrarily\
    \ small echo differences to induce well defined phase shifts between fat and water\
    \ signal components. To reduce the required scan time, the echo shifting was implemented\
    \ into a 3D variable flip angle RARE sequence (Rapid Acquisition with Refocused\
    \ Echoes, ES-VFA-RARE) which allows high RARE factors with excellent image quality5.\
    \ Using this sequence, the abstract attempts to bridge the typical MRI mm scale\
    \ to the histological microscale by recovering super high resolution fat signal\
    \ fraction maps in ex vivo liver tissue at 100\u03BCm.\nMaterials and methods\n\
    MRI data were acquired on a Bruker BioSpec 94/20USR AVIII scanner using a 72mm\
    \ (phantom) or 60mm (ex vivo sample) quadrature transceiver coil. To assess the\
    \ phase shift created by progressively changing the echo shift value, ES-VFA-RARE\
    \ images were acquired on a kerosene gel (a.k.a. paraffin or lamp oil) - water\
    \ phantom with the 41 echo times = [-0.72:0.036:0.72] ms, fig. 1). The scan parameters\
    \ of ES-VFA-RARE for phantom study were TA=6.5min for each echo shift, TR=1500ms,\
    \ TE=63ms, BW=200kHz, resolution 0.44 x 0.44 x 0.55 mm3.Ex vivo acquisition was\
    \ performed on a liver sample, harvested from a rat which received high fat diet\
    \ for 12 weeks. The scan parameters were TA=4h 10min per echo shift, TR=1000ms,\
    \ echo shifts= [-0.367,-0.357,-0.129,-0.059,0,0.059,0.178,0.367,0.397,0.416] ms,\
    \ echo spacing 3.6ms, TE=18ms, RARE factor=60, 10 averages, BW=400kHz, isotropic\
    \ resolution of (0.1mm)3. Fat-water separation was performed by fitting the following\
    \ signal model:\n\nS(T_E) = S_0\u2022(1 + f exp(i \u2022 \u03C9_\u0394fw\u2022\
    \ T_E))\u2022 exp(i \u2022 (\u03C9_\u0394B0\u2022 T_E+\u03C6_0))\n\nwhere $\\\
    omega_{\\Delta fw} = \\gamma \u0392_0 \\sigma = 8.8\\times 10^3$ rad / s, assumed\
    \ to be the fat-water frequency shift; Optimisation was performed with respect\
    \ to $S_0$, signal fat fraction f, off-resonance frequency \u03C9_{\u0394B0},\
    \ and phase after the RF pulse $\\phi_0$. It was implemented in JAX6 to leverage\
    \ automatic differentiation and is performed using a variable projection method,\
    \ VARPRO7,8, with nonlinear parameters \u03C9_{\u0394B0} and \u03C60 optimised\
    \ using AdaBelief optimiser9,10.\nResults\nFig. 1 displays a clear boundary between\
    \ kerosene and water. The phase difference across the boundary changes linearly\
    \ with the applied echo shift. Fig. 2 shows the original MRI images and the results\
    \ of the fat-water signal fraction separation. The calculated fat signal fraction\
    \ ranges to approx. 22% in the areas with highest fat concentration. The B0 map\
    \ shows primarily the residual linear gradient along the readout direction, together\
    \ with a characteristic dipole field from, most likely an air bubble. The \u03C6\
    0 map shows the effects of the initial RF pulse for different tissue properties\
    \ (e.g. electric conductivity). In Fig. 3 two large landmarks could be matched,\
    \ in a first step, between MR images and low magnification histology. Following\
    \ deeper inspection a small area of an MRI-derived fat distribution could be matched\
    \ to a small area in the histology slide at higher magnification.\nDiscussion\n\
    Pieces of an entire rat liver were scanned with a very high isotropic resolution\
    \ of 100mm3 using a large 60mm volume coil. To achieve sufficient SNR for voxelwise\
    \ fat separation, rather long scan times were necessary, which would have been\
    \ prohibitively long without the high RARE factors possible with the ES-VFA-RARE\
    \ sequence. Complex non-linear optimisation is facilitated by the VARPRO algorithm,\
    \ leveraging the separable nature of the problem, as well as by a total of 10\
    \ different echo shifts, providing high SNR for the fat-water separation. The\
    \ very high resolution of the MR acquisitions allows to bridge the gap between\
    \ the reconstructed fat fraction maps and \u03BCm histological images, showing\
    \ qualitative agreement between the spatial distributions. Quantification of the\
    \ fat proton density fraction, however, requires further calibrations to remove\
    \ different signal weighting of fat and water due to their different T1 and T2\
    \ times.\nConclusion\nEcho shifting was successfully incorporated into a scan-time\
    \ efficient ES-VFA-RARE sequence, allowing high resolution acquisition of liver\
    \ samples and subsequent Dixon based fat signal separation. The MRI images at\
    \ 100\u03BCm resolution started to resolve the enhanced periportal fat depositions\
    \ and fine structures in the local liver lobe as well as the larger scale differences\

  title: Journals in Systems Biology could improve their impact factor by enforcing
    reproducibility
  authors: "H\xF6pfl Sebastian, Radde Nicole"
  abstract: "Systems Biology is at the forefront of developing and using modeling\
    \ standards to improve the reproducibility and reuse of models. Still, a recent\
    \ study by Tiwari et al. showed that only every second model out of a set of 455\
    \ models could be directly reproduced (Tiwari et al. 2021). This limited reproducibility\
    \ shows the need for further efforts or mechanisms that promote reproducibility.\
    \ Reproducibility of scientific results fosters collaborations and leads ultimately\
    \ to faster progress in the whole field and increased trust in science. Since\
    \ these merits are mainly long-term and not immediate for the publishing researcher,\
    \ it seems crucial that third parties like publishing companies or funding organizations\
    \ foster reproducibility. For example, the largest German research funding organization\
    \ (German Research Foundation, DFG) signed 2003 the \"Berlin Declaration on Open\
    \ Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities\" and has since been engaged\
    \ in promoting open source and reusable data and publications.\nHere, we applied\
    \ Bayesian Estimation to analyze the citation count of reproducible against non-reproducible\
    \ models of the periods 1985-2020 and 2013-2020. The Bayesian Estimation Supersedes\
    \ the t-Test method of J. Kruschke uses the Non-Central T-distribution to handle\
    \ outliers in the data and estimates the distribution parameters via Markow-Chain-Monte-Carlo\
    \ sampling (Kruschke 2013). The parameters are mean and sigma parameters for each\
    \ dataset and a shape parameter that is jointly sampled for both datasets. Posterior\
    \ predictive distributions for the difference of means and standard deviations\
    \ and the effect size can be calculated from the posterior distributions of the\
    \ parameters. From these, decisions are made via the 95% Highest Density Interval\
    \ (HDI) of the difference of means posterior predictive distribution. Specifically,\
    \ a decision can be made if the 95% values with the highest credibility (95% HDI)\
    \ indicate a difference above or below zero.\nFrom 1985 to 2020, there was no\
    \ credible difference between reproducible and non-reproducible models. However,\
    \ reproducible models got more citations, starting in 2013, ten years after the\
    \ introduction of Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) (H\xF6pfl et al. 2023).\
    \ There seems to be a tilting point between 2010 and 2013, from a tendency of\
    \ more citations for reproducible papers to more than 95% credibility for higher\
    \ citation rates for reproducible papers. 2013 seems to be a reasonable time when\
    \ the efforts of the Systems Biology community towards reproducibility pay off,\
    \ i.e. it needed about ten years from the introduction of the de facto model standards\
    \ SBML and CellML until the difference in citations became significant.\nOn the\
    \ one hand, this shows an immediate benefit for the individual researcher. On\
    \ the other hand, this only pays off over the years and is, for example, for Ph.D.\
    \ researchers who want to go into industry after their doctorate not relevant.\
    \ However, journals could benefit directly and in the long run from an increased\
    \ citation rate. At the same time, stricter reproducibility guidelines of journals\
    \ would promote reproducibility and could thus strengthen trust in science. Our\
    \ analysis shows that the higher citation numbers of reproducible models cannot\
    \ be explained by the fact that they were published in journals with a higher\
    \ Journal Impact Factor (JIF). For this purpose, the citation counts were normalized\
    \ to the respective JIF, and\nthe normalized groups were compared. It was found\
    \ that reproducibility leads to an increase\nin the number of citations independent\
    \ of the respective JIF. The data indicate that, on\naverage, journals in the\
    \ field of Systems Biology could potentially increase their impact factor\nby\
    \ about 30% by only forcing reproducibility.\nReproducibility can be substantially\
    \ improved with little effort. The authors of Tiwari et al.\nhave assembled eight\
    \ points to improve model reproducibility in a scorecard, whereby\nreproducibility\
    \ is already significantly increased if only four of them are fulfilled. It is\
    \ our\nappeal that everyone can do something for better scientific work through\
    \ reproducible work.\nOn the one hand, the individual researchers. On the other\
    \ hand, the journals and funding\norganizations. In the end, the joint effort\
    \ could pay off for the entire scientific community."

  title: Outlier Detection in Steatosis Data using Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification
    via FAIR Modelling Tools
  authors: "H\xF6pfl Sebastian, Albadry Mohamed, Dahmen Uta, B\xF6ttcher Michael and\
    \ Radde Nicole"
  abstract: "Finding outliers in experimental data is important because they can mask\
    \ differences between different experimental conditions. Often this is done by\
    \ applying a rigid Z-score, independently for each sample time. The Z-score (\U0001D44D\
    =\U0001D465\U0001D456\u2212\U0001D465\U0001D460) calculates for each data point\
    \ \U0001D465\U0001D456 the distance between the data point and the population\
    \ mean \U0001D465 and normalizes this distance to the standard deviation of the\
    \ dataset \U0001D460. A data point with a Z-score of two is often considered an\
    \ outlier, as this is outside the 95.45% highest density interval of a normal\
    \ distribution. The disadvantages of this method are a rigid decision threshold\
    \ and that a possible inherent dynamic of time series data cannot be included.\
    \ Here, we applied a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) Bayesian\
    \ uncertainty quantification to include the inherent dynamics of the system and\
    \ thus use the complete time course information. Bayesian uncertainty quantification\
    \ allows making probability statements about outlier classification and differences\
    \ in the dynamics across various experimental conditions.\nHere, we use experimental\
    \ data derived from a pharmacokinetic experiment in steatotic mice (Albadry et\
    \ al. 2022). Animals received a drug cocktail consisting of Caffeine, Codeine\
    \ and Midazolam. Drug levels were determined throughout 6h. Since the data were\
    \ obtained from living animals, they are naturally subject to considerable uncertainties\
    \ and are therefore well suited for the analysis. Here, the Bayesian analysis\
    \ takes the differences in the dynamics between poor and rapid metabolizers into\
    \ account. The pharmacokinetics of these drugs can be described by a peaked concentration\
    \ upon injection, followed by an exponential decay. This knowledge was used to\
    \ set up an ordinary differential equation \U0001D465\u0307=(1\u2212\U0001D434\
    \u22C5\U0001D461)\u22C5\U0001D452\U0001D435\u2212\U0001D434\u22C5\U0001D461, which\
    \ was implemented in the SBML format. PEtab, a standard format for the integration\
    \ of biological data into models was used to make state-of-the-art sampling algorithms\
    \ applicable.\nBayesian uncertainty quantification classifies outliers according\
    \ to the 95% credibility interval of the posterior predictive distribution. Experimental\
    \ data points outside of this interval were considered outliers. Furthermore,\
    \ the consideration of the 95% credibility intervals for the different fat diets\
    \ (experimental conditions) allowed us to credibly detect differences in the metabolization\
    \ dynamics of the drugs. This revealed in our dataset, that the severity and pattern\
    \ of periportal steatosis were associated with changes in the pharmacokinetics\
    \ of Caffeine, but not of Codeine.\nIn summary, we applied FAIR modeling tools\
    \ for experimental data analysis in systems medicine. This gives access to efficient,\
    \ state-of-the-art algorithms that are developed and maintained by the active\
    \ modeling community. Furthermore, the use of standard formats ensures a reproducible\
    \ and reusable data analysis. Therefore, data, code and the SBML and PEtab files\
    \ were uploaded to Fairdomhub."

  title: Reproducible models in Systems Biology are higher cited
  authors: "H\xF6pfl Sebastian, Radde Nicole"
  abstract: 'The Systems Biology community was among the first scientific communities
    to recognize the need for reproducible models. Still, many published models are
    not reproducible. Tiwari et al. currently classified 328 published models by their
    reproducibility. They found out that only every second model was directly reproducible.
    We use this classification to analyze if reproducible models in Systems Biology
    have a higher impact in terms of citation numbers. For the analysis, we use Bayesian
    Estimation, which provides complete distributional information for group means
    and standard deviations. Outliers are handled via a non-central t-distribution.
    Beginning about ten years after the introduction of SBML (2013), reproducibility
    gained broad awareness in the Systems Biology community. Since then, reproducible
    models have gotten significantly more citations than non-reproducible ones. Our
    analysis shows 95% credibility for higher citation rates of reproducible models
    for 2013-2020, and all investigated sub-periods after 2013 to 2020.

    Further, normalization to the journal impact factor showed that journals of all
    ranks could profit by forcing reproducibility. In conclusion, reproducible models
    offer long-term benefits for journals and individual researchers in terms of more
    citations. The higher citation count provides evidence for increased reuse of
    these models and could promote progress in Systems Biology.'
