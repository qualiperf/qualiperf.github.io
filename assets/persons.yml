  description: Within the research unit QuaLiPerF this project aims for  multi-scale
    understanding of the interplay between hepatic perfusion and function after extended
    hepatectomy (ePHx) in rats.  A comprehensive MRI toolbox at 9.4T will provide
    spatially resolved, multi-parametric quantitative in vivo information under various
    experimental conditions. The collected data, together with the iterative computational
    modeling and data integration, will allow a better prediction of the recovery
    of liver function.

  description: 'Within the research unit QuaLiPerF this project aims for a multi-scale
    understanding of the interplay between hepatic perfusion and function after extended
    hepatectomy (ePHx) in rats.  My role in the project is to develop and perform
    multi-parametric quantitative MRI investigating liver function. The scopes contain
    a volumetry of lobule size, hepatic perfusion, and fat droplet deposition after
    surgery. '
