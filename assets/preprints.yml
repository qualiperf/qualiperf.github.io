  abstract: Science continues to become more interdisciplinary and to involve increasingly
    complex data sets. Many projects in the biomedical and health related sciences
    adhere to the principles of FAIR data sharing, or aim to follow them. Data sharing
    has been proven to foster collaboration, to lead to better research outcomes,
    and to help ensure reproducibility of results. Data generated in biomedical and
    health research are specific in the sense that they are heterogeneous, often big,
    and highly sensitive in terms of data protection needs and contextuality. Data
    sharing has to respect these features, but at the same time advances in medical
    therapy and treatment are time-critical. Modeling and simulation of biomedical
    processes have become an established tool, and a global community has been developing
    algorithms, methodologies, and standards for applying biomedical simulation models
    in clinical research. However, it can be difficult for clinician scientists to
    follow the specific rules and recommendations for FAIR data sharing within the
    domain. With this paper, we aim to clarify the standard workflow for sharing experimental
    and clinical data with the simulation modeling community. By following these recommendations,
    data sharing will be improved, collaborations will become more effective, and
    the FAIR publication and subsequent reuse of data will become possible at the
    level of quality necessary in biomedical and health related sciences.

- title: Physiologically based modeling of the effect of physiological and anthropometric
    variability on indocyanine green based liver function tests
  authors: "Adrian K\xF6ller, Jan Grzegorzewski and Matthias K\xF6nig"
  abstract: 'Accurate evaluation of liver function is a central task in hepatology.
    Dynamic liver function tests (DLFT) based on the time-dependent elimination of
    a test substance provide an important tool for such a functional assessment. These
    tests are used in the diagnosis and monitoring of liver disease as well as in
    the planning of hepatobiliary surgery. A key challenge in the evaluation of liver
    function with DLFTs is the large inter-individual variability. Indocyanine green
    (ICG) is a widely applied test compound used for the evaluation of liver function.
    After an intravenous administration, pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters are calculated
    from the plasma disappearance curve of ICG which provide an estimate of liver
    function. The hepatic elimination of ICG is affected by physiological factors
    such as hepatic blood flow or binding of ICG to plasma proteins, anthropometric
    factors such as body weight, age, and sex, or the protein amount of the organic
    anion-transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3) mediating the hepatic uptake of ICG.
    Being able to account for and better understand these various sources of inter-individual
    variability would allow to improve the power of ICG based DLFTs and move towards
    an individualized evaluation of liver function.

    Within this work we systematically analyzed the effect of various factors on ICG
    elimination by the means of computational modeling. For the analysis, a recently
    developed and validated physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) model of
    ICG distribution and hepatic elimination was utilized. Key results are (i) a systematic
    analysis of the variability in ICG elimination due to hepatic blood flow, cardiac
    output, OATP1B3 abundance, liver volume, body weight and plasma bilirubin level;
    (ii) the evaluation of the inter-individual variability in ICG elimination via
    a large \emph{in silico} cohort of n=100000 subjects based on the NHANES cohort
    with special focus on stratification by age, sex, and body weight; (iii) the evaluation
    of the effect of various degrees of cirrhosis on variability in ICG elimination.

    The presented results are an important step towards individualizing liver function
    tests by elucidating the effects of confounding physiological and anthropometric
    parameters in the evaluation of liver function via ICG.'

- title: 'Pharmacokinetics of caffeine: A systematic analysis of reported data for
    application in metabolic phenotyping and liver function testing'
  authors: "Jan Grzegorzewski, Florian Bartsch, Adrian K\xF6ller, Matthias K\xF6nig"
  abstract: 'Caffeine is by far the most ubiquitous psychostimulant worldwide found
    in tea, coffee, cocoa, energy drinks, and many other beverages and food. Caffeine
    is almost exclusively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P-450 enzyme
    system to the main product paraxanthine and the additional products theobromine
    and theophylline. Besides its stimulating properties, two important applications
    of caffeine are metabolic phenotyping of cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) and liver
    function testing. An open challenge in this context is to identify underlying
    causes of the large inter-individual variability in caffeine pharmacokinetics.
    Data is urgently needed to understand and quantify confounding factors such as
    lifestyle (e.g. smoking), the effects of drug-caffeine interactions (e.g. medication
    metabolized via CYP1A2), and the effect of disease.

    Here we report the first integrative and systematic analysis of data on caffeine
    pharmacokinetics from 148 publications and provide a comprehensive high-quality
    data set on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine, caffeine metabolites, and their
    metabolic ratios in human adults. The data set is enriched by meta-data on the
    characteristics of studied patient cohorts and subjects (e.g. age, body weight,
    smoking status, health status), the applied interventions (e.g. dosing, substance,
    route of application), measured pharmacokinetic time-courses, and pharmacokinetic
    parameters (e.g. clearance, half-life, area under the curve).

    We demonstrate via multiple applications how the data set can be used to solidify
    existing knowledge and gain new insights relevant for metabolic phenotyping and
    liver function testing based on caffeine. Specifically, we analyzed (i) the alteration
    of caffeine pharmacokinetics with smoking and use of oral contraceptives; (ii)
    drug-drug interactions with caffeine as possible confounding factors of caffeine
    pharmacokinetics or source of adverse effects; (iii) alteration of caffeine pharmacokinetics
    in disease; and (iv) the applicability of caffeine as a salivary test substance
    by comparison of plasma and saliva data. In conclusion, our data set and analyses
    provide important resources which could enable more accurate caffeine-based metabolic
    phenotyping and liver function testing.'

- title: Prediction of survival after hepatectomy using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic
    model of indocyanine green liver function tests
  authors: "Adrian K\xF6ller, Jan Grzegorzewski, Michael Tautenhahn, Matthias K\xF6\
    nig"
  abstract: The evaluation of hepatic function and functional capacity of the liver
    are essential tasks in hepatology as well as in hepatobiliary surgery. Indocyanine
    green (ICG) is a widely applied test compound that is used in clinical routine
    to evaluate hepatic function. Important questions for the functional evaluation
    with ICG in the context of hepatectomy are how liver disease such as cirrhosis
    alters ICG elimination, and if postoperative survival can be predicted from preoperative
    ICG measurements. Within this work a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)
    model of ICG was developed and applied to the prediction of the effects of a liver
    resection under various degrees of cirrhosis. For the parametrization of the computational
    model and validation of model predictions a database of ICG pharmacokinetic data
    was established. The model was applied (i) to study the effect of liver cirrhosis
    and liver resection on ICG pharmacokinetics; and (ii) to evaluate the model-based
    prediction of postoperative ICG-R15 as a measure for postoperative outcome. Key
    results are the accurate prediction of changes in ICG pharmacokinetics caused
    by liver cirrhosis and postoperative changes of ICG-elimination after liver resection,
    as validated with a wide range of data sets. Based on the PBPK model, individual
    survival after liver resection could be classified, demonstrating its potential
    value as a clinical tool.

- title: 'Quasi-Entropy Closure: A Fast and Reliable Approach to Close the Moment
    Equations of the Chemical Master Equation'
  authors: Vincent Wagner, Benjamin Castellaz, Marco Oesting, Nicole Radde
  abstract: 'Motivation The Chemical Master Equation is the most comprehensive stochastic
    approach to describe the evolution of a (bio-)chemical reaction system. Its solution
    is a time-dependent probability distribution on all possible configurations of
    the system. As the number of possible configurations is typically very large,
    the Master Equation is often practically unsolvable. The Method of Moments reduces
    the system to the evolution of a few moments of this distribution, which are described
    by a system of ordinary differential equations. Those equations are not closed,
    since lower order moments generally depend on higher order moments. Various closure
    schemes have been suggested to solve this problem, with different advantages and
    limitations. Two major problems with these approaches are first that they are
    open loop systems, which can diverge from the true solution, and second, some
    of them are computationally expensive.


    Results Here we introduce Quasi-Entropy Closure, a moment closure scheme for the
    Method of Moments which estimates higher order moments by reconstructing the distribution
    that minimizes the distance to a uniform distribution subject to lower order moment
    constraints. Quasi-Entropy closure is similar to Zero-Information closure, which
    maximizes the information entropy. Results show that both approaches outperform
    truncation schemes. Moreover, Quasi-Entropy Closure is computationally much faster
    than Zero-Information Closure. Finally, our scheme includes a plausibility check
    for the existence of a distribution satisfying a given set of moments on the feasible
    set of configurations. Results are evaluated on different benchmark problems.'

    SBML'
  authors: "Matthias K\xF6nig* , Leandro H. Watanabe, Jan Grzegorzewski, Chris J.\n\
    Myers"
  abstract: 'ABSTRACT2

    Computational models in systems biology and systems medicine are typically simulated
    using a single formalism such as ordinary differential equations (ODE). However,
    more complex models require the coupling of multiple formalisms since different
    biological phenomena are better described by different methods. For example, metabolism
    in steady state is often modeled using flux-balance analysis (FBA) whereas dynamic
    changes of model components are better described via ODEs. The coupling of FBA
    and ODE modeling formalisms results in dynamic FBA models. A major challenge is
    how to describe such hybrid models that couple multiple formalisms in a standardized
    way so that they can be exchanged between tools and simulated consistently in
    a reproducible manner. This paper presents a scheme for encoding and implementation
    of dynamic FBA models in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), thereby enabling
    the exchange of multi-framework computational models between software tools. We
    demonstrate the feasibility of the approach using various example models and show
    that different tools are able to simulate the hybrid models and agree on the results.
    As part of this work, two independent implementations of a multi-framework simulation
    method for dynamic FBA have been developed supporting such models: iBioSim and
    sbmlutils.'

- title: FAIR Sharing of Reproducible Models of Epidemic and Pandemic Forecast
  authors: "Ramachandran K.*, K\xF6nig M.*, Scharm M., Nguyen T.V.N, Hermjakob H.,\
    \ Waltemath D., Malik Sheriff R.S."
  abstract: A major challenge for the dissemination, replication, and reuse of epidemiological
    forecasting studies during COVID-19 pandemics is the lack of clear guidelines
    and platforms to exchange models in a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and
    Reusable (FAIR) manner, facilitating reproducibility of research outcomes. During
    the beginning of pandemics, models were developed in diverse tools that were not
    interoperable, opaque without traceability and semantics, and scattered across
    various platforms - making them hard to locate, infer and reuse. In this work,
    we demonstrate that implementing the standards developed by the systems biology
    community to encode and share COVID-19 epidemiological models can serve as a roadmap
    to implement models as a tool in medical informatics, in general. As a proof-of-concept,
    we encoded and shared 24 epidemiological models using the standard format for
    model exchange in systems biology, annotated them with cross-references to data
    resources, packed up all associated files in COMBINE archives for easy sharing,
    and finally, disseminated the models through BioModels repository to significantly
    enhance their reproducibility and repurposing potential. We recommend the use
    of systems biology standards to encode and share models of epidemic and pandemic
    forecasts to improve their findability, accessibility, interoperability, reusability,
    and reproducibility.

- title: Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling of the role of CYP2D6
    polymorphism for metabolic phenotyping with dextromethorphan
  authors: "Grzegorzewski J., Brandhorst J., K\xF6nig M."
  abstract: The cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a key xenobiotic-metabolizing enzyme
    involved in the clearance of many drugs. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6 contribute
    to the large inter-individual variability in drug metabolism and could affect
    metabolic phenotyping of CYP2D6 probe substances such as dextromethorphan (DXM).
    To study this question, we (i) established an extensive pharmacokinetics dataset
    for DXM; and (ii) developed and validated a physiologically based pharmacokinetic
    (PBPK) model of dextromethorphan (DXM) and its metabolites dextrorphan (DXO) and
    dextrorphan O-glucuronide (DXO-Glu) based on the data. Drug-gene interactions
    (DGI) were introduced by accounting for changes in CYP2D6 enzyme kinetics depending
    on activity score (AS), which in combination with AS for individual polymorphisms
    allowed us to model of CYP2D6 gene variants. Variability in CYP3A4 and CYP2D6
    activity was modeled based on in vitro data from human liver microsomes. Model
    predictions are in very good agreement with pharmacokinetics data for CYP2D6 polymorphisms,
    CYP2D6 activity as measured by AS, and CYP2D6 metabolic phenotypes (UM, EM, IM,
    PM). The model was applied to investigate the genotype-phenotype association and
    the role of CYP2D6 polymorphisms for metabolic phenotyping with dextromethorphan
    using the urinary cumulative metabolic ratio DXM/(DXO+DXO-Glu) (UCMR). The effect
    of parameters on UCMR was studied via sensitivity analysis. Model predictions
    indicate very good robustness against the intervention protocol (i.e. application
    form, dosing amount, dissolution rate, and sampling time) and good robustness
    against physiological variation. The model is capable of estimating the UCMR dispersion
    within and across populations depending on activity scores. Moreover, the distribution
    of UCMR and the risk of genotype-phenotype mismatch could be estimated for populations
    with known CYP2D6 genotype frequencies. The model can be applied as a tool for
    individual prediction of UCMR and metabolic phenotype based on CYP2D6 genotype.
    Both, model and database are freely available for reuse.

- title: Simvastatin therapy in different subtypes of hypercholesterolemia - a physiologically
    based modelling approach
  authors: "Bartsch F. , Grzegorzewski J., Pujol H., Tautenhahn HM., K\xF6nig M."
  abstract: 'Hypercholesterolemia is a multifaceted plasma lipid disorder with heterogeneous
    causes including lifestyle and genetic factors. A key feature of hypercholesterolemia
    is elevated plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Several
    genetic variants have been reported to be associated with hypercholesterolemia,
    known as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Important variants affect the LDL
    receptor (LDLR), which mediates the uptake of LDL-C from the plasma, apoliporotein
    B (APOB), which is involved in the binding of LDL-C to the LDLR, and proprotein
    convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which modulates the degradation of
    the LDLR. A typical treatment for hypercholesterolemia is statin medication, with
    simvastatin being one of the most commonly prescribed statins. In this work, the
    LDL-C lowering therapy with simvastatin in hypercholesterolemia was investigated
    using a computational modeling approach. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic
    model of simvastatin integrated with a pharmacodynamic model of plasma LDL-C (PBPK/PD)
    was developed based on extensive data curation. A key component of the model is
    LDL-C turnover by the liver, consisting of: hepatic cholesterol synthesis with
    the key enzymes HMG-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase; cholesterol export from
    the liver as VLDL-C; de novo synthesis of LDLR; transport of LDLR to the membrane;
    binding of LDL-C by LDLR via APOB; endocytosis of the LDLR-LDL-C complex; recycling
    of LDLR from the complex. The model was applied to study the effects of simvastatin
    therapy in hypercholesterolemia due to different causes in the LDLR pathway corresponding
    to different subtypes of hypercholesterolemia. Model predictions of LDL-C lowering
    therapy were validated with independent clinical data sets. Key findings are:
    (i) hepatic LDLR turnover is highly heterogeneous among FH classes; (ii) despite
    this heterogeneity, simvastatin therapy results in a consistent reduction in plasma
    LDL-C regardless of class; and (iii) simvastatin therapy shows a dose-dependent
    reduction in LDL-C. Our model suggests that the underlying cause of hypercholesterolemia
    does not influence simvastatin therapy. Furthermore, our model supports the treatment
    strategy of stepwise dose adjustment to achieve target LDL-C levels. Both the
    model and the database are freely available for reuse.'

- title: A Consensus Model of Glucose-Stimulated Insulin Secretion in the Pancreatic
    beta-Cell
  authors: "Maheshvare MD., Raha S., K\xF6nig M.*, and Pal D.*"
  abstract: The pancreas plays a critical role in maintaining glucose homeostasis
    through the secretion of hormones from the islets of Langerhans. Glucose-stimulated
    insulin secretion (GSIS) by the pancreatic beta-cell is the main mechanism for
    reducing elevated plasma glucose. Here we present a systematic modeling workflow
    for the development of kinetic pathway models using the Systems Biology Markup
    Language (SBML). Steps include retrieval of information from databases, curation
    of experimental and clinical data for model calibration and validation, integration
    of heterogeneous data including absolute and relative measurements, unit normalization,
    data normalization, and model annotation. An important factor was the reproducibility
    and exchangeability of the model, which allowed the use of various existing tools.
    The workflow was applied to construct the first consensus model of GSIS in the
    pancreatic beta-cell based on experimental and clinical data from 39 studies spanning
    50 years of pancreatic, islet, and beta-cell research in humans, rats, mice, and
    cell lines. The model consists of detailed glycolysis and equations for insulin
    secretion coupled to cellular energy state (ATP/ADP ratio). Key findings of our
    work are that in GSIS there is a glucose-dependent increase in almost all intermediates
    of glycolysis. This increase in glycolytic metabolites is accompanied by an increase
    in energy metabolites, especially ATP and NADH. One of the few decreasing metabolites
    is ADP, which, in combination with the increase in ATP, results in a large increase
    in ATP/ADP ratios  in the beta-cell with increasing glucose. Insulin secretion
    is dependent on ATP/ADP, resulting in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The
    observed glucose-dependent increase in glycolytic intermediates and the resulting
    change in ATP/ADP ratios and insulin secretion is a robust phenomenon observed
    across data sets, experimental systems and species. Model predictions of the glucose-dependent
    response of glycolytic intermediates and insulin secretion are in good agreement
    with experimental measurements. Our model predicts that factors affecting ATP
    consumption, ATP formation, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and ATP/ADP-dependent
    insulin secretion have a major effect on GSIS. In conclusion, we have developed
    and applied a systematic modeling workflow for pathway models that allowed us
    to gain insight into key mechanisms in GSIS in the pancreatic beta-cell.

  abstract: The field of metabolic modelling at the genome-scale continues to grow
    with more models being created and curated. This comes with an increasing demand
    for adopting common principles regarding transparency and versioning, in addition
    to standardisation efforts regarding file formats, annotation and testing. Here,
    we present a standardised template for git-based and GitHub-hosted genome-scale
    metabolic models (GEMs) supporting both new models and curated ones, following
    FAIR principles (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability),
    and incorporating best-practices. standard-GEM facilitates the reuse of GEMs across
    web services and platforms in the metabolic modelling field and enables automatic
    validation of GEMs. The use of this template for new models, and its adoption
    for existing ones, paves the way for increasing model quality, openness, and accessibility
    with minimal effort.

- title: A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for CYP2E1 phenotyping via
    chlorzoxazone
  authors: "J. K\xFCttner, J. Grzegorzewski, HM. Tautenhahn, M. K\xF6nig"
  abstract: The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of enzymes plays a critical role
    in the metabolism of drugs, toxins, and endogenous and exogenous compounds. The
    activity of CYP enzymes can be influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics,
    diet, age, environmental factors, and disease. Among the major isoforms, CYP2E1
    is of particular interest due to its involvement in the metabolism of various
    low molecular weight chemicals, including alcohols, pharmaceuticals, industrial
    solvents, and halogenated anesthetics. Metabolic phenotyping of CYPs based on
    the elimination of test compounds is a useful method for assessing in vivo activity,
    with chlorzoxazone being the primary probe drug for phenotyping of CYP2E1. The
    aim of this work was to investigate the effect of changes in CYP2E1 level and
    activity, ethanol consumption, ethanol abstinence, and liver impairment on the
    results of metabolic phenotyping with chlorzoxazone. To accomplish this, an extensive
    pharmacokinetic dataset for chlorzoxazone was established and a physiologically
    based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of chlorzoxazone and its metabolites, 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone
    and chlorzoxazone-O-glucuronide, was developed and validated. The model incorporates
    the effect of ethanol consumption on CYP2E1 levels and activity by extending the
    model with a core ethanol pharmacokinetic model and a CYP2E1 turnover model. The
    model accurately predicts pharmacokinetic data from several clinical studies and
    is able to estimate the effect of changes in CYP2E1 levels and activity on chlorzoxazone
    pharmacokinetics. Regular ethanol consumption induces CYP2E1 over two to three
    weeks, resulting in increased conversion of chlorzoxazone to 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone
    and a higher 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone/chlorzoxazone metabolic ratio. After ethanol
    withdrawal, CYP2E1 levels return to baseline within one week. Importantly, liver
    impairment has an opposite effect, resulting in reduced liver function via CYP2E1.
    In alcoholics with liver impairment who also consume ethanol, these factors will
    have opposite confounding effects on metabolic phenotyping with chlorzoxazone.
