- abstract: "In the context of severe liver diseases, the prediction of the treatment
    outcome mainly relies on observational clinical data reflecting liver function
    as a whole at best. These, however, are impacted by the individual situation of
    the patient comprising age, gender, comorbidities, pre-treatment medication, and
    general physical conditions. In hepatology and gastroenterology disciplines, algorithms
    have been developed to grade acute liver failure emerging on the ground of chronic
    diseases like cirrhosis. However, in liver surgery, a reliable risk assessment
    for postoperative liver failure, a severe complication with often fatal consequences
    for the patient, is still lacking. Yet, to improve the therapeutic and/or surgical
    outcome of patients suffering from liver diseases, both in internal medicine and
    surgery disciplines, concrete guidelines based on reliable clinical data and predictive
    algorithms are urgently needed.\n\nThe liver represents a multiscale network comprising
    three levels: organ, lobe, and cell level. In addition, hepatic functions are
    distributed heterogeneously throughout the parenchyma, rendering the hepatocytes
    surrounding the portal tracts to execute, e.g., ammonia fixation by ureagenesis,
    and hepatocytes surrounding the hepatic vein to fix ammonia via the glutamine
    synthetase reaction. Thus, multiscale models describing liver function may unequivocally
    help to design predictive tools for assessing the surgical risk and the probability
    of therapeutic success.\nRecent developments of computational models make it possible
    to describe organ functions on different scales. It is the goal of this Research
    Topic, to collect papers involving cutting-edge approaches of multiscale computational
    modeling in the context of liver surgery and interventions. We invite authors
    to send their latest and highly innovative research or comprehensive review articles
    related to the scope of this Research Topic.\n\nTo predict post-treatment liver
    function before surgical, radiological, or pharmacological interventions is the
    most challenging task for clinicians when treating severe liver diseases. Based
    on the individual unique situation of the patient, novel therapy concepts are
    warranted in order to stratify therapy outcome. In order to open the perspective
    for the development of predictive tools anticipating liver function post-treatment,
    we invite submissions entailing computational approaches of liver modeling or
    methodology for a data-based patient-specific risk assessment in the context of
    liver surgery and interventions. Research should address, but is not restricted
    to modeling and data-based analysis of hepatic metabolism, liver perfusion, regeneration,
    and communication with other organs. Research dealing with multiscale modeling
    is specifically encouraged. We also greatly appreciate research comprising machine
    learning/artificial intelligence methods including knowledge-driven approaches
    and consideration of uncertainty."

  title: CONTINUUM BIOMECHANICS OF ACTIVE SYSTEMS
- abstract: "The liver is the central metabolic organ in the mammalian body. Numerous
    in silico models have been constructed to simulate liver functions such as circulation,
    drug transport, metabolism, and clearance at the organism, organ, lobular, cellular,
    and molecular levels. Adding to the complexity of the spatial dimension are the
    vastly different temporal scales: from the membrane transport of drug molecules
    within milliseconds to viral infection of liver tissues in days or months. In
    recent years there has been a growing trend in the liver modeling community to
    integrate models at different spatial and temporal scales. For example, a model
    for the transport of drugs in sinusoids could be coupled with metabolic kinetics
    models in hepatocytes, whilst incorporating the heterogeneous distribution of
    metabolic enzymes and transporters along the metabolic zones in liver lobules.
    Multiscale liver modeling will benefit from recent developments in Systems Biology
    and/or Systems Medicine.\n\nThis Research Topic is to provide a venue for showcasing
    the concepts, methodology, experimental data, and computational tools associated
    with multiscale liver modeling. The main challenge in multiscale modeling is to
    bridge models at different scales. For example, surgical intervention drastically
    changes perfusion at the organism level, leading to elevated shear stress at the
    sinusoidal level, which in turn stimulates liver regeneration. Liver diseases
    progressing over the course of months affect clearance processes at the time scale
    of hours. Toxic liver injury occurs at the cellular level but affects the circulation
    of metabolites at the organism level. In addition to models spanning the different
    scales, integrating cellular and molecular level models and experimental data
    are the very core of multiscale liver modeling.\n\nThe contributions to the Research
    Topic include Original Research papers, (Mini) Reviews, and Opinions on liver
    modeling. The specific topics include:\n\n- Blood flow models for large hepatic
    vessels and/or sinusoids;\n- Liver tissue models and virtual lobule models;\n
    - Imaging and image analysis techniques for revealing microstructure and processes
    at multiple scales;\n- Mechanistic factors underlying liver diseases (e.g., steatosis,
    fibrosis, cirrhosis, cancer)\n\nProjects at the interface of Biomechanics and
    Computational Biology can also be considered, including:\n- Drug uptake, metabolism,
    and clearance models;\n- Numerical/mathematical methods for bridging models at
    different temporal and spatial scales;\n- Application of Systems Biology and Physiome
    to multiscale liver modeling."

  title: Frontiers Research Topic “Multiscale Modeling for the Liver”
- abstract: "Active mechanisms are found across multiple scales in biological systems
    and are responsible for a variety of basic functions of living organisms, such
    as the simulation-driven conversion of chemical to mechanical energy in muscle
    tissue, metabolic processes, growth and remodeling, or adaptive movements of plants.
    In this minisymposium, we aim to generate a fruitful interdisciplinary exchange
    as well as to synergize various aspects\nrelated to the modeling of active biomechanical
    systems and interfaces between model and clinical application. Therefore, we welcome
    contributions from all topics in the context of biomechanics having any type of
    active component. These may range from material models for biological tissues,
    the simulation of biological systems of any type, and biomechanical models for
    various applications in biomimetics, biomedicine, or others–from the microscale
    to the organ scale. The minisymposium is intended to span a wide range from basic
    methods to clinical applications and thus provides an insight into the state of
    the art across the entire spectrum of active biological systems modeling. We welcome
    contributions on modeling methodologies of active materials as well as those that–possibly
    as a first step towards a longer-term goal–specialize in passive properties of
    active materials."

- abstract: The liver is the main organ involved in the clearance of most drugs, e.g.,
    acetaminophen. The function of the liver can be evaluated using information about
    the clearance of test drugs (pharmacokinetics data) in combination with computational
    models describing the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME)
    of these substances in the human body. Within this lab project a physiologically
    based model of the elimination of an example drug in the human body will be established
    based on existing literature data. Such a model allows us to simulate in silico
    the pharmacokinetics of the example drugs and evaluate hypotheses, for instance,
    on drug-drug interactions or alterations in drug metabolism in disease or with
    age. The project will focus on acetylsalicylic acid or omeprazole (but other drugs
    could be used). The project is a computational project requiring basic programming
    skills, no wet lab work will be performed.

  title: Computational Modeling of Drug Detoxification – A Systems Medicine Approach
- abstract: 'Background: Liver transplantation (LTx) is the only curative treatment
    option for acute and chronic end-stage liver disease. Demographic change and western
    lifestyle result in an increasing rate of elderly multi-morbid potential recipients
    and donors. Liver grafts from such donors, so-called marginal liver grafts, are
    often affected by hepatic steatosis compromising the quality of the donor organ
    substantially. One reason is the alteration of the tissue structure, resulting
    in an impaired perfusion, which in turn affects hepatic metabolism and organ function.
    In case of a marginal graft, the surgeon is faced with the clinical decision to
    either accept or reject the organ, significantly increasing the postoperative
    risk for the recipient or increasing the risk of death on the waiting list, respectively.
    Two major challenges for marginal grafts are the storage between procurement of
    the organ and transplantation (cold ischemia time) and damage after reperfusion
    (ischemia reperfusion injury or IRI).Goal: Our co-designed interdisciplinary project
    “SIMulation supported LIVer Assessment for donor organs (SimLivA)” aims to mathematically
    model the impact of mechanical alterations of the (steatotic) marginal liver graft
    and cold ischemia on early IRI. We address the following research questions: (i)
    How to co-design computational methods, experimental studies, clinical processes,
    and technical workflows? (ii) How to improve the multiscale continuum-biomechanical
    model for prediction of IRI? (iii) How to obtain experimental and clinical data
    that are essential to quantify the relationship between steatosis, ischemia and
    reperfusion injury? (iv) How to evaluate the clinical usability of the model?Methods:
    To achieve these goals, we will extend and adapt our coupled continuum-biomechanical
    multiphase and multi-scale PDE-ODE model of the liver lobule to numerically simulate
    IRI in dependence of the degree of steatosis and ischemia duration. Experimental
    and clinical data acquisition for model parameterization and validation is designed
    in close collaboration with modeling. A proof-of-concept trial for clinical applicability
    will be performed. Our model couples structure, perfusion and function of the
    liver via the interplay between mechanical properties of the graft, hepatic sinusoidal
    perfusion and the affected molecular pathways, which might facilitate these decision
    processes and is urgently needed. This will be the first step towards an in-silico
    clinical decision support tool to reach a better decision pro or contra the marginal
    organ by in-silico predicting hepatic damage and early graft function.'

  title: SIMulation supported LIVer Assessment for donor organs (SimLivA) - Continuum-biomechanical
    modeling for staging of ischemia reperfusion injury during liver transplantation
- abstract: "Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Diagnosis
    and treatment are time-critical and require highly patient-specific diagnostic
    and treatment pathways. Medical decision-making is based on a multitude of interdependent
    factors related to various medical disciplines, past experiences and clinical
    guidelines. The consideration of all decision factors in combination with the
    possible therapy approaches is a major challenge for the physicians and often
    cannot be solved in an optimal way even in the interdisciplinary tumor board.
    In this project, we develop ATLAS, a decision support tool, which will significantly
    assist clinicians with this challenge. Based on AI methods, ATLAS processes all
    relevant patient data from databases, systems medicine and continuum biomechanical
    in silico prognoses modeling data as well as individual patient data. The tool
    will be developed in a co-design approach by experts in surgical oncology, mathematical
    modeling, and machine learning.\nChosen technologies integrate the automated understanding
    of a highly complex patient situation through the simulation of liver functions
    with expert knowledge and ontology-guided learning with knowledge graphs from
    retrospective cases of liver tumors.\nATLAS will be based on detailed historical
    data cohort from over 6,000 patients with liver tumors and will be evaluated on
    case studies at the Jena University Hospital. The integration of medical expert
    knowledge, mathematical modeling and artificial intelligence constitutes a highly
    original and most promising approach for high-quality diagnoses and treatments
    of liver tumors resulting in patient-specific prognosis improvement.\nScientific
    insights from this projects will offer exploitation possibilities for the transfer
    to malignancies in other organs, such as lungs, kidneys or the brain.\nTool and
    demonstrator development will provide for sustainable exploitation pathways for
    future commercial applications."

    the body - is a key challenge in treating people. Angiotensin converting enzyme
    (ACE) inhibitors and diuretics are two classes of drugs used to treat high blood

    of lectures, tutorials and practical work by the students. The research project
    is aimed at students with a STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics)
    background, including biology, computer science and medical students. Basic programming
    skills in Python are required.\n\nWith the X-Student Research Groups, the Berlin
    University Alliance supports research teams consisting of young researchers and
