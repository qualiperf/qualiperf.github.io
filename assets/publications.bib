 abstract = {Aging is a risk factor for adipose tissue dysfunction, which is associated with inflammatory innate immune mechanisms. Since the adipose tissue/liver axis contributes to hepatosteatosis, we sought to determine age-related adipose tissue dysfunction in the context of the activation of the innate immune system fostering fatty liver phenotypes. Using wildtype and immune-deficient mice, we compared visceral adipose tissue and liver mass as well as hepatic lipid storage in young (ca. 14 weeks) and adult (ca. 30 weeks) mice. Adipocyte size was determined as an indicator of adipocyte function and liver steatosis was quantified by hepatic lipid content. Further, lipid storage was investigated under normal and steatosis-inducing culture conditions in isolated hepatocytes. The physiological age-related increase in body weight was associated with a disproportionate increase in adipose tissue mass in immune-deficient mice, which coincided with higher triglyceride storage in the liver. Lipid storage was similar in isolated hepatocytes from wildtype and immune-deficient mice under normal culture conditions but was significantly higher in immune-deficient than in wildtype hepatocytes under steatosis-inducing culture conditions. Immune-deficient mice also displayed increased inflammatory, adipogenic, and lipogenic markers in serum and adipose tissue. Thus, the age-related increase in body weight coincided with an increase in adipose tissue mass and hepatic steatosis. In association with a (pro-)inflammatory milieu, aging thus promotes hepatosteatosis, especially in immune-deficient mice.},

@article{Hodneland.2019,
 abstract = {A large variety of severe medical conditions involve alterations in microvascular circulation. Hence, measurements or simulation of circulation and perfusion has considerable clinical value and can be used for diagnostics, evaluation of treatment efficacy, and for surgical planning. However, the accuracy of traditional tracer kinetic one-compartment models is limited due to scale dependency. As a remedy, we propose a scale invariant mathematical framework for simulating whole brain perfusion. The suggested framework is based on a segmentation of anatomical geometry down to imaging voxel resolution. Large vessels in the arterial and venous network are identified from time-of-flight (ToF) and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Macro-scale flow in the large-vessel-network is accurately modelled using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, whereas capillary flow is treated as two-compartment porous media flow. Macro-scale flow is coupled with micro-scale flow by a spatially distributing support function in the terminal endings. Perfusion is defined as the transition of fluid from the arterial to the venous compartment. We demonstrate a whole brain simulation of tracer propagation on a realistic geometric model of the human brain, where the model comprises distinct areas of grey and white matter, as well as large vessels in the arterial and venous vascular network.

 abstract = {The presence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant complication of cirrhosis because it changes the prognosis and the treatment of the patients. By now, contrast-enhanced CT and MR scans are the most reliable tools for the diagnosis of HCC; however, in some cases, a biopsy of the tumor is necessary for the final diagnosis. The aim of the study was to develop a diagnostic tool using the microRNA (miRNA) profiles of the tissue surrounding the HCC tumor combined with clinical parameters in statistical models. At a transplantation setting, 32 patients with HCC and cirrhosis (B) were compared to 22 patients suffering from cirrhosis only (A). The diagnosis and exclusion of HCC was confirmed following the histopathological examination of the explanted liver. The HCC patients were significantly older than the patients with cirrhosis only (B: 60.6 and A: 49.9, p{\textless}0.001) and showed higher levels of ALT (A: 0.76\textgreek{m}kat/l, B: 1.02\textgreek{m}kat/, p=0.006) and AFP (A: 5.8ng/ml, B: 70.3ng/ml, p{\textless}0.001), whereas the bilirubin levels were higher in the cirrhosis only group (p=0.002). Using age (cut-off 50.23years) and AFP (cut-off 4.2ng/ml) thresholds, the levels of expression of miR-1285-3p and miR-943 differentiated between the patients with HCC and cirrhosis from those with cirrhosis only with an accuracy of 96.3{\%}. This is the first report about the use of stepwise penalized logistic regression and decision tree analyses of miRNA expressions in the tumor-surrounding tissue combined with clinical parameters for the diagnosis of HCC.},

 abstract = {AIM

To analyze time intervals of inflammation and regeneration in a cholestatic rat liver model.

METHODS

In 36 Lewis rats, divided into six groups of 6 animals (postoperative observation periods: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 wk), the main bile duct was ligated with two ligatures and observed for the periods mentioned above. For laboratory evaluation, cholestasis parameters (bilirubin, \textgreek{g}-GT), liver cell parameters (ASAT, ALAT) and liver synthesis parameters (quick, albumin) were determined. For histological analysis, HE, EvG, ASDCL and HMGB-1 stainings were performed. Furthermore, we used the mRNA of IL-33, GADD45a and p-21 for analyzing cellular stress and regeneration in cholestatic rats.

RESULTS

In chemical laboratory and histological evaluation, a distinction between acute and chronic cholestatic liver injury with identification of inflammation and regeneration could be demonstrated by an increase in cholestasis (bilirubin: 1-wk group, 156.83 $\pm$ 34.12 \textgreek{m}mol/L, P = 0.004) and liver cell parameters (ASAT: 2-wk group, 2.1 $\pm$ 2.19 \textgreek{m}mol/L.s, P = 0.03; ALAT: 2-wk group, 1.03 $\pm$ 0.38 \textgreek{m}mol/L.s, P = 0.03) after bile duct ligation (BDL). Histological evaluation showed an increase of bile ducts per portal field (3-wk group, 48 $\pm$ 6.13, P = 0.004) during the first four weeks after bile duct ligation. In addition to inflammation, which is an expression of acute cholestasis, there was an increase of necrotic areas in the histological sections (2-wk group, 1.38{\%} $\pm$ 2.28{\%} per slide, P = 0.002). Furthermore, the inflammation could be verified by ASDCL (4-wk group, 22 $\pm$ 5.93 positive cells per portal field, P = 0.041) and HMGB-1 [2-wk group, 13 $\pm$ 8.18 positive cells per field of view (FoV), P = 0.065] staining. Therefore, in summary of the laboratory evaluation and histological studies, acute cholestasis could be found during the first four weeks after bile duct ligation. Subsequently, the described parameters declined so that chronic cholestasis could be assumed. For quantification of secondary biliary cirrhosis, eosin staining was performed, which did not reveal any signs of liver remodeling, thus precluding the development of a chronic cholestasis model. Additionally, to establish the chronic cholestasis model, we evaluated liver regeneration capacity through measurements of IL-33, p-21 and GADD45a mRNA.

CONCLUSION

We created a chronic cholestasis model. The point of inflammatory and regenerative balance was reached after four weeks. This finding should be used for experimental approaches dealing with chronic cholestatic liver damage.},

@article{Horn.2016,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Stress hyperglycaemia (SHG) is a common complication in sepsis associated with poor outcome. Chemerin is an adipocytokine associated with inflammation and impaired glucose homeostasis in metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). We aimed to investigate how alterations of circulating chemerin levels and corresponding visceral adipose tissue (VAT) expression are linked to glucose metabolism and prognosis in sepsis.

METHODS

Clinical data and tissue samples were taken from a cross-sectional study including control, T2D and sepsis patients, all undergoing laparotomy. A second independent patient cohort of patients with sepsis was included to evaluate associations with prognosis. This was complemented by a murine model of peritoneal infection and a high-fat diet. We analysed circulating chemerin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and VAT messenger RNA (mRNA) expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction.

RESULTS

Circulating chemerin was increased in sepsis 1.69-fold compared with controls (p = 0.012) and 1.47-fold compared with T2D (p = 0.03). Otherwise, chemerin VAT mRNA expression was decreased in patients with sepsis (p = 0.006) and in septic diabetic animals (p = 0.009). Circulating chemerin correlated significantly with intra-operative glucose (r = 0.662; p = 0.01) and in trend with fasting glucose (r = 0.528; p = 0.052). After adjusting for body mass index or haemoglobin A1c, chemerin correlated in trend with insulin resistance evaluated using the logarithmised homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (r = 0.539, p = 0.071; r = 0.553, p = 0.062). Chemerin was positively associated with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score in patients with sepsis (p = 0.036) and with clinical severity in septic mice (p = 0.031). In an independent study population, we confirmed association of chemerin with glucose levels in multivariate linear regression analysis (\textgreek{b} = 0.556, p = 0.013). In patients with sepsis with SHG, non-survivors had significantly lower chemerin levels than survivors (0.38-fold, p = 0.006), while in patients without SHG, non-survivors had higher chemerin levels, not reaching significance (1.64-fold, p = 0.089). No difference was apparent in patients with pre-existing T2D (p = 0.44).

CONCLUSIONS

We show, for the first time to our knowledge, that chemerin is increased in sepsis and that it associates with impaired glucose metabolism and survival in these patients. It could be further evaluated as a biomarker to stratify mortality risk of patients with SHG.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Portal vein embolization is a treatment option to achieve a sufficient future remnant liver volume for patients with central liver tumours requiring an extended resection with an extensive parenchymal loss. However, molecular mechanisms of this intervention are up to now poorly understood. The objective of this prospective pilot study was the characterization of molecular events leading to late hypertrophy of the non-embolized liver tissue in the human liver.

METHODS

Liver tissue of ten patients was collected before and intraoperatively more than one month after embolization. Investigation of molecular features was performed by pangenomic chips, polymerase chain reaction, immunostaining of proliferation marker Ki-67 and immunofluorescence measurements.

RESULTS

Significantly elevated genes hint towards angiogenesis and signalling by insulin-like growth factor and associated binding proteins. Increased transcript levels of activator protein 1 complex members like c-jun were reflecting potential molecular events of liver growth after embolization. Immunofluorescence data confirmed a predominant upregulation of \textgreek{b}-catenin and c-jun (p{\textless}0.1) supported by Ki-67 (p{\textless}0.05) in the non-embolized liver. In silico analysis of transcriptomic dysplasia and hepatocellular carcinoma data showed divergent signatures compared to embolization.

CONCLUSIONS

Our findings indicate a sustained regeneration after portal vein embolization reflected in hyperplasia and angiogenesis in the human liver and provide novel molecular mechanisms of interlobe crosstalk.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignancy worldwide. The occurrence of liver metastases worsens the prognosis of the patient significantly if the tumor burden is not resectable. Liver transplantation might be an option for otherwise irresectable colorectal liver metastases. In this study, we evaluate the role of two-stage hepatectomy in combination with a left-lateral living donor liver transplantation.

METHODS

Patients with irresectable liver metastases having a stable disease or tumor regression after at least 8~weeks of systemic chemotherapy without an extrahepatic tumor burden (except resectable lung metastases) are suitable for study inclusion. A randomization is not planned since the control arm (systemic chemotherapy) is well established and the superiority of the transplantation procedure has to be expected. The surgical treatment consists of two steps: in a first operation, a left hemihepatectomy in the recipient will be performed. At this place, the left lateral liver lobe (segments II and III) of a living donor will be transplanted. To induce a growth of the graft, a portal vein ligation will be performed. Approximately after 2~weeks, the removal of the right hemiliver will be conducted if the control imaging shows a sufficient growth of the graft.

RESULTS

The patient recruitment is ongoing. In total, three patients have been already transplanted with this protocol. Up to now, they are tumor-free and in good clinical health.

DISCUSSION

With the design of the LIVER-T(W)O-HEAL study, it might be possible to offer patients with otherwise irresectable colorectal liver metastases a curative treatment option. The key point of this study will be, most probably, the patient's selection.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis, not associated with cirrhosis or tumours, is the second most frequent cause of portal hypertension worldwide. Especially in children, anatomic mesenterico-portal interposition (REX-shunt) has become an established treatment. The changes in hepatic microcirculation after reperfusion of the shunt have not been investigated so far.

AIMS

This study investigates the hepatic microcirculation before and after REX-shunt interposition using orthogonal polarization spectral imaging (OPS).

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Since 2004, three consecutive patients with extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis underwent REX-shunt interposition. We measured the hepatic microcirculation by OPS before and directly after REX-shunt reperfusion and analysed the capillary vessel diameter, red blood cell velocity, functional capillary density and volumetric blood flow. Furthermore, we compared our values with the physiological values of the hepatic microcirculation defined previously by other investigators.

RESULTS

All shunts showed an excellent function in the follow-up investigations. The intra-individual microcirculatory analysis revealed a reduction in the red blood cell velocity after shunt reperfusion in particular.

CONCLUSIONS

Our results provide preliminary evidence for the reversal of the hepatic arterial buffer response following the restoration of the portal venous blood flow. This may be a short-term effect because of the restored portal venous blood flow.},

Liver graft dysfunction can deteriorate to complete organ failure and increases perioperative morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. Therapeutic strategies reducing the rate of graft dysfunction are of current clinical relevance. One approach is the systemic application of prostaglandins, which were demonstrated to be beneficial in reducing ischemia-reperfusion injury. Preliminary data indicate a positive effect of prostacyclin analogue iloprost on allograft viability after liver transplantation. The objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of iloprost in a multi-center trial.

METHODS/DESIGN

A prospective, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter study in a total of 365 liver transplant recipients was designed to assess the effect of intravenous iloprost after liver transplantation. Primary endpoint will be the primary graft dysfunction characterized as presentation of one or more of the following criteria: ALAT or ASAT level{\textgreater}2000 IU/ml within the first 7 postoperative days, bilirubine  $\geq$ 10 mg/dl on postoperative day 7; INR $\geq$ 1.6 on postoperative day 7 or initial non-function. Secondary endpoints are parameters of post-transplant morbidity, like rates of infections, biliary complications, need of clotting factors or renal replacement therapy and the graft and patient survival.

 abstract = {INTRODUCTION

Tumor recurrence is the most frequent cause of death after liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma. We selected ten other prognostic classifications to evaluate their potential to predict the risk of recurrence after LT for HCC as compared to the Milan classification. All of the other scores have not been compared with one another in a single cohort.

METHODS

Data of 147 consecutive patients transplanted at our department between 1996 and 2014 were analyzed and staged for morphological and functional scores of underlying liver disease. For long-term follow-up, we analyzed intrahepatic (within the liver~$\pm$~distant metastases) and extrahepatic (distant metastases only) recurrence separately.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS

The median survival time for all patients was 106~months. The 5- and 10-year observed survival rates were 61 and 43{\%}, respectively. The observed cumulative 5- and 10-year recurrence rates were 37 and 39{\%}, respectively, 10-year intrahepatic and extrahepatic recurrence rates were 12 and 27{\%}, respectively. Median survival time after diagnosis of first recurrence was 7.5 (0-120) months; 2 and 18~months for all, intra- and extrahepatic recurrence, respectively. UCSF-, up to seven-, Shanghai Fudan- or Duvoux classifications can identify patients with a cumulative 10-year recurrence rate below 20{\%}. The pre-therapeutic AFP level should be considered in addition to the geometry of the intrahepatic lesions.},

 abstract = {PURPOSE

Patients over 70~years of age are characterised by diminished long-term survival rates following resection of colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to younger patients. The aim of this study was to clarify whether reduced survival is a result of malignancy, comorbidities or the treatment received.

METHODS

All patients with CRC, who were admitted to our institution over a period of 10~years, were selected from a prospectively maintained database. Disease-specific, disease-free and overall survival rates were calculated dependent on variables considered potentially relevant for the patients' prognosis.

RESULTS

915 patients were included in the study. Observed 5- and 10-year survival rates for the whole group were 48~$\pm$~2{\%} and 40~$\pm$~2{\%}, respectively, but 10-year survival rates dropped to 14~$\pm$~4{\%} for patients aged 80 and older. Resection of the primary tumour was attempted in all cases independent of age. Emergency admission, Charlson index $\geq$2, ECOG $\geq$2, old age, second malignancies, distant metastases, high grading and non-resective surgery were identified as independent prognostic parameters associated with decreased overall survival. In contrast, disease-specific and disease-free survival rates for patients after elective radical resection in UICC-stage I-III did not show significant differences related to age. Tumour site, UICC-stage and resection status were independent statistically significant predictors of disease-specific survival.

CONCLUSIONS

Similar disease-specific survival rates in all age groups speak in favour of tumour resection in curative intent even in old patients. Better outcome may be achieved, if regular screening for colorectal cancer is considered even in the elderly to avoid late presentation requiring emergency surgery.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Cholangiocarcinoma is an infrequent malignancy, often unresectable at the time of diagnosis. Liver transplantation may offer a chance for cure, but results in the past have been disappointing, prompting transplant centres to adopt multimodal treatment protocols and extreme patient selection.

PURPOSE

This study was designed to evaluate the outcome of patients with irresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma undergoing liver transplantation in order to determine criteria for patient selection.

METHODS

We reviewed our prospective cancer registry for patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma treated by transplantation since 1997. Data were evaluated regarding tumour location, stage, overall survival, recurrence rates and prognostic factors.

RESULTS

Liver transplantation with lymphadenectomy was realised in 16 patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Seven patients received a living donor graft. Lymph node metastases were found in eight patients with a median of 13 harvested nodes and had a statistically significant negative impact on overall survival irrespective of tumour size. Only one patient underwent neoadjuvant brachytherapy and developed fatal septic complications; 3- and 5-year survival rates were 63 and 50 {\%} in lymph node-negative patients without neoadjuvant treatment.

CONCLUSIONS

Acceptable survival rates can be achieved by transplantation for hilar cholangiocarcinoma with lymph node metastases as the only exclusion criterion. We recommend staging laparotomy with lymphadenectomy along the common hepatic artery prior to liver transplantation.},

 abstract = {PURPOSE

Prognosis after resection of liver metastases of colorectal cancer is influenced by a variety of clinical factors. For more than 20~years, efforts have been made to restructure and simplify prognostic parameters into clinical scores. We evaluated the influence of various clinical and pathological factors on survival and recurrence and developed a simple model for risk stratification.

METHODS

We have analyzed a total of 13 prognostic factors in 382 consecutive and prospectively enrolled R0-resected patients and applied our data set to ten published prognostic scoring systems. Prognostic factors that influenced disease-specific and disease-free survival were included into a model clinical risk score.

RESULTS

The 5- and 10-year observed survival rates were 43{\%} and 28{\%}, respectively, for all 382 patients. The disease-specific 5- and 10-year survival rates were 49{\%} and 37{\%}, respectively; the 5- and 10-year recurrence rates were 68{\%} and 70{\%}, respectively. For patients with synchronous liver metastases, survival was not affected by the timing of liver resection. The prognosis after treatment of any recurrence was best after the accomplishment of a repeated R0 situation, independent of the location of the recurrence. In the multivariate analysis, the disease-specific survival and recurrence rates were statistically significantly influenced by more than three lymph node metastases of the primary tumor, more than two lesions within the liver, and the presence of extrahepatic tumor.

CONCLUSIONS

From these data, we have developed a simple score for the risk stratification which may be useful for future studies on interdisciplinary management of colorectal liver metastases.},

We descriptively analysed the data of LDLTs in Germany from 15 December 2006 to 31 December 2009 using a multi-center retrospective analysis via a questionnaire and data provided by Eurotransplant. Ten German centers performed LDLTs in adults. Eighty four transplantations in 50 male recipients and 34 female recipients were performed during the review period, ranging from 1 to 16 LDLTs per center. Hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis (15/84) was the most common transplantation indication. The recipient mean lab-MELD score was 15 ($\pm$8). Six re-transplantations were necessary after initial LDLTs. The 1-year patient survival was 81{\%}. We obtained data of 79/84 donors. The incidence of complications was 30.4{\%} (n = 24). There were no grade 5 complications according to the Clavien classification. LDLT is an established treatment option that may reduce the waiting time, provides high quality split liver grafts and should be advocated in the MELD era to reduce organ shortage and 'death on the waiting list'.},

 abstract = {The expression of proteinase-activated receptor (PAR)(2) in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was established by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, confocal immunofluorescence and electron microscopy in permanent cell lines, primary HCC cell cultures and HCC tumor tissue. Stimulation of HCC cells with trypsin and the PAR(2)-selective activating peptide, 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH(2), increased cell invasion across Matrigel. Both effects were blocked by a PAR(2)-selective pepducin antagonist peptide (pal-PAR(2)) and by PAR(2) silencing with specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). PAR(2)-initiated HCC cell invasion was also blocked by inhibiting the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (Met receptor tyrosine kinase) with the receptor-targeted kinase inhibitors, SU 11274 and PHA 665752, or by downregulation of Met with specific siRNA. The involvement of Met in PAR(2)-mediated HCC invasive signaling was further supported by the finding that treatment of HCC cells with trypsin or the PAR(2)-selective agonist peptide, 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH(2), stimulated Met activation-phosphorylation. In addition, Met-dependent stimulation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein Kinases was found to be critical for the PAR(2)-Met receptor tyrosine kinase-invasive signaling axis in HCC cells. Our study establishes an important link between the PAR(2) and Met receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in promoting HCC cell invasion.},

 abstract = {Vascular invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major risk factor for poor outcome after liver transplantation (LT). The aim of this retrospective analysis was to assess the value of preoperative positron emission tomography (PET) using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) in liver transplant candidates with HCC for predicting microvascular tumor invasion (MVI) and posttransplant tumor recurrence. Forty-two patients underwent LT for HCC after PET evaluation. Sixteen patients had an increased (18)F-FDG tumor uptake on preoperative PET scans (PET +), while 26 recipients revealed negative PET findings (PET-) pre-LT. PET- recipients demonstrated a significantly better 3-year recurrence-free survival (93{\%}) than PET + patients (35{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001). HCC recurrence rate was 50{\%} in the PET + group, and 3.8{\%} in the PET-population (p {\textless} 0.001). PET + status was identified as independent predictor of MVI [hazard ratio: 13.4]. Patients with advanced PET negative tumors and patients with HCC meeting the Milan criteria had a comparable 3-year-recurrence-free survival (80{\%} vs. 94{\%}, p = 0.6). Increased (18)F-FDG uptake on PET is predictive for MVI and tumor recurrence after LT for HCC. Its application may identify eligible liver transplant candidates with tumors beyond the Milan criteria.},

abstract     = {The need for extended liver resection is increasing due to the growing incidence of liver tumors in aging societies. Individualized surgical planning is the key for identifying the optimal resection strategy and to minimize the risk of postoperative liver failure and tumor recurrence. Current computational tools provide virtual planning of liver resection by taking into account the spatial relationship between the tumor and the hepatic vascular trees, as well as the size of the future liver remnant. However, size and function of the liver are not necessarily equivalent. Hence, determining the future liver volume might misestimate the future liver function, especially in cases of hepatic comorbidities such as hepatic steatosis. A systems medicine approach could be applied, including biological, medical, and surgical aspects, by integrating all available anatomical and functional information of the individual patient. Such an approach holds promise for better prediction of postoperative liver function and hence improved risk assessment. This review provides an overview of mathematical models related to the liver and its function and explores their potential relevance for computational liver surgery. We first summarize key facts of hepatic anatomy, physiology, and pathology relevant for hepatic surgery, followed by a description of the computational tools currently used in liver surgical planning. Then we present selected state-of-the-art computational liver models potentially useful to support liver surgery. Finally, we discuss the main challenges that will need to be addressed when developing advanced computational planning tools in the context of liver surgery.},

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) supported tissue protection in a variety of acute and chronic diseases, and might hence ameliorate AKI induced by extended liver resection. Here, 70\% liver resection was performed in male pigs. MSCs were infused through a central venous catheter and haemodynamic parameters as well as markers of acute kidney damage were monitored under intensive care conditions for 24 h post-surgery. Cytokine profiles were established to anticipate the MSCs' potential mode of action. After extended liver resection, hyperdynamic circulation, associated with hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia, an increase in serum aldosterone and low urine production developed. These signs of hepatorenal dysfunction and haemodynamic impairment were corrected by MSC treatment. MSCs elevated PDGF levels in the serum, possibly contributing to circulatory homeostasis. Another 14 cytokines were increased in the kidney, most of which are known to support tissue regeneration. In conclusion, MSCs supported kidney and liver function after extended liver resection. They probably acted through paracrine mechanisms improving haemodynamics and tissue homeostasis. They might thus provide a promising strategy to prevent acute kidney injury in the context of post-surgery acute liver failure.},

Liver tumors often require extended liver resection, overburdening metabolic and regenerative capacities of the remnant organ. Resulting dysfunction and failure may be improved by the proregenerative characteristics of MSCs. Extended liver resection was performed in (DPPIV)-deficient F344-Fischer rats. Wild-type animals served as donors of peritoneal adipose-derived MSCs. These were predifferentiated in vitro into hepatocytic cells and delivered to the liver by splenic application. Liver-related blood parameters (international normalized ratio, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase) and liver histology (hematoxylin-eosin, Sudan III) were determined to monitor liver function. Metabolic changes were assessed by metabolomic analyses in the remnant liver and the serum. Liver damage and regeneration were quantified by determination of the apoptotic and proliferation rates. MSCs supported survival after partial hepatectomy. They decreased liver-related blood parameters indicative for the improvement of liver function. The extensive lipid accumulation in hepatocytes illustrating the metabolic overload after resection was attenuated. Treatment with MSCs normalized imbalance of amino acids, acylcarnitines, sphingolipids, and glycerophospholipids in the liver and blood. Furthermore, MSCs decreased the apoptotic rate and increased the proliferation rate. The experimental time period (48 hours) was too short to allow for integration of MSCs into the host liver. Thus, the mode of action was probably indirect. MSCs ameliorated hepatic dysfunction and improved liver regeneration after extended resection by paracrine mechanisms. They may represent a new therapeutic option to treat posthepatectomy acute liver failure.},

It was, therefore, the aim of this study to investigate the distribution of the adherens junction components E- and N-cadherin, which are important determinants of tissue cohesion. E-cadherin was expressed in periportal but not in perivenous hepatocytes. In contrast, N-cadherin was more enriched towards the perivenous hepatocytes. In agreement, β-catenin, which links both cadherins via α-catenin to the actin cytoskeleton, was expressed ubiquitously. This zonal expression of cadherins was preserved in acute liver injury after treatment with acetaminophen or partial hepatectomy, but disrupted in chronic liver damage like in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or α1-antitrypsin deficiency. Hepatocyte proliferation during acetaminophen-induced liver damage was predominant at the boundary between the damaged perivenous and the intact periportal parenchyma indicating a minor contribution of periportal hepatocytes to liver regeneration. In NASH livers, an oval cell reaction was observed pointing to massive tissue damage coinciding with the gross impairment of hepatocyte proliferation. In the liver parenchyma, metabolic functions are distributed heterogeneously. For example, the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and E-cadherin overlapped in periportal hepatocytes. Thus, during liver regeneration after acute damage, the intact periportal parenchyma might sustain essential metabolic support like glucose supply or ammonia detoxification. However, disruption of epithelial integrity during chronic challenges may increase susceptibility to metabolic liver diseases such as NASH or vice versa. This might suggest the regulatory integration of tissue cohesion and metabolic functions in the liver. },

To improve our understanding of the mechanisms involved in this zonation patterning, we developed a mathematical multicompartment model of hepatic fatty acid metabolism accompanied by blood flow simulations. A model analysis determines the influence of the uptake process of fatty acids, the porto-central gradient of plasma fatty acid concentration, and the oxygen supply via blood on the zonation of triglyceride accumulation. From this theoretical perspective, the plasma oxygen gradient, but not the fatty acid gradient, leads the way to a zonated triglyceride accumulation by its decisive role in oxidative processes. In addition, the uptake mechanism of fatty acids seems to be fundamental for a pericentral dominance of steatosis. However, the mechanism of cellular fatty acid uptake from the blood is still under debate. Our theoretical approach supports the transporter-mediated uptake mechanism and reveals that the maximal velocity of fatty acid uptake affects the switching between a periportal and a pericentral triglyceride accumulation. Further research on hepatic fatty acid uptake is needed to push forward our understanding of aberrant triglyceride accumulation in diet-induced steatosis.},

	abstract        = {Liver regeneration consists of cellular proliferation leading to parenchymal and vascular growth. This study complements previous studies on cellular proliferation and weight recovery by (1) quantitatively describing parenchymal and vascular regeneration, and (2) determining their relationship. Both together are needed to (3) characterize the underlying growth pattern. Specimens were created by injecting a polymerizing contrast agent in either portal or hepatic vein in normal or regenerating livers after 70\% partial hepatectomy. 3D image data were obtained through micro-CT scanning. Parenchymal growth was assessed by determining weight and volume of the regenerating liver. Vascular growth was described by manually determined circumscribed parameters (maximal vessel length and radius of right inferior portal/hepatic vein), automatically determined cumulative parameters (total edge length and total vascular volume), and parameters describing vascular density (total edge length/volume, vascular volume fraction). The growth pattern was explored by comparing the relative increase of these parameters to the increase expected in case of isotropic expansion. Liver volume recovery paralleled weight recovery and reached 90\% of the original liver volume within 7 days. Comparing radius-related vascular parameters immediately after surgical resection and after virtual resection in-silico revealed a slight increase, possibly reflecting the effect of resection-induced portal hyperperfusion. Comparing length-related parameters between post-operative day 7 and after virtual resection showed similar vascular growth in both vascular systems investigated. In contrast, radius-related parameters increased slightly more in the portal vein. Despite the seemingly homogeneous 3D growth, the observed vascular parameters were not compatible with the hypothesis of isotropic expansion of liver parenchyma and vascular structures. We present an approach for the quantitative analysis of the vascular systems of regenerating mouse livers. We applied this technique for assessing the hepatic growth pattern. Prospectively, this approach can be used to investigate hepatic vascular regeneration under different conditions.},

We performed the procedures based on anatomic study. The ALPPS procedure consisted of a 70\% PVL (occluding the left median, left lateral, and right lobes), parenchymal transection (median lobe) and partial (10\%) hepatectomy (PHx; caudate lobe). The transection effect was evaluated by measuring the extent of hepatic atrophy or regeneration of individual liver lobes in the ALPPS and control groups (70\% PVL and 10\% PHx without transection). The survival rates after stage II resection and collateral formation within the portal vein system was examined. Anatomic study revealed a close spatial relationship between the demarcation line and the middle median hepatic vein. This enabled placing the transection plane without injuring the hepatic vein. Transection was achieved via stepwise clamping, followed by 2-3 parenchyma-preserving piercing sutures on both sides of the clamp. Ligated liver lobes atrophy was significantly enhanced after ALPPS compared with the control group. In contrast, both a significantly greater relative weight of the regenerated lobe and proliferation index on the first postoperative day were observed. All animals tolerated stage II-resection without complications. Portoportal collaterals were only observed in the control group. We developed an anatomically precise technique for parenchymal transection. The lack of a dense vascular network between the portalized and deportalized lobes may play an important role in accelerating regeneration and atrophy augmentation.},

LEWIS-Rats and C57Bl/6N-Mice were subjected to ex-vivo imaging using μCT. The image data were used for semi-automated segmentation to extract the hepatic vascular tree as prerequisite for 3D visualization. The underlying vascular anatomy was reconstructed, analysed and used for determining hepatic vascular territories. The four major liver lobes have their own lobar portal supply and hepatic drainage territories. In contrast, the paracaval liver is supplied by various small branches from right and caudate portal veins and drains directly into the vena cava. Variations in hepatic vascular anatomy were observed in terms of branching pattern and distance of branches to each other. The portal vein anatomy is more variable than the hepatic vein anatomy. Surgically relevant variations were primarily observed in portal venous supply. For the first time the key variations of intrahepatic vascular anatomy in mice and rats and their surgical implications were described. We showed that lobar borders of the liver do not always match vascular territorial borders. These findings are of importance for the design of new surgical procedures and for understanding eventual complications following hepatic surgery.},

The method accurately identified fat droplets with sensitivity and specificity values above 90\%. Compared with commonly-used shape features, adjacency statistics greatly improved the sensitivity toward clustered fat droplets by 29\% and the specificity by 17\%. On a standard personal computer, megapixel images were processed in less than 0.05s.

Here we demonstrate in an allogeneic model of Brown Norway rat kidneys transplanted into uninephrectomized Lewis rats the successful implementation of the recently developed glucose chemical exchange saturation transfer (glucoCEST) magnetic resonance imaging. This technique is a novel method to assess and differentiate AR. Renal allografts undergoing AR showed significantly increased glucoCEST contrast ratios of cortex to medulla of 1.61 compared to healthy controls (1.02), syngeneic Lewis kidney to Lewis rat transplants without rejection (0.92), kidneys with ischemia reperfusion injury (0.99) and kidneys affected by cyclosporine A toxicity (1.10). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed an area under the curve value of 0.92, and the glucoCEST contrast ratio predicted AR with a sensitivity of 100\% and a specificity of 69\% at a threshold level over 1.08. In defined animal models of kidney injuries, the glucoCEST contrast ratios of cortex to medulla correlated positively with mRNA expression levels of T-cell markers (CD3, CD4, CD8a/b), but did not correlate to impaired renal perfusion. Thus, the glucoCEST parameter may be valuable for the assessment and follow up treatment of AR.},

	abstract        = {This work's aim was to minimize the acquisition time of a radial 3D ultra-short echo-time (UTE) sequence and to provide fully automated, gradient delay compensated, and therefore artifact free, reconstruction. The radial 3D UTE sequence (echo time 60 μs) was implemented as single echo acquisition with center-out readouts and improved time efficient spoiling on a clinical 3T scanner without hardware modifications. To assess the sequence parameter dependent gradient delays each acquisition contained a quick calibration scan and utilized the phase of the readouts to detect the actual k-space center. This calibration scan does not require any user interaction. To evaluate the robustness of this automatic delay estimation phantom experiments were performed and 19 in vivo imaging data of the head, tibial cortical bone, feet and lung were acquired from 6 volunteers. As clinical application of this fast 3D UTE acquisition single breath-hold lung imaging is demonstrated. The proposed sequence allowed very short repetition times (TR~1ms), thus reducing total acquisition time. The proposed, fully automated k-phase based gradient delay calibration resulted in accurate delay estimations (difference to manually determined optimal delay -0.13 ± 0.45 μs) and allowed unsupervised reconstruction of high quality images for both phantom and in vivo data. The employed fast spoiling scheme efficiently suppressed artifacts caused by incorrectly refocused echoes. The sequence proved to be quite insensitive to motion, flow and susceptibility artifacts and provides oversampling protection against aliasing foldovers in all directions. Due to the short TR, acquisition times are attractive for a wide range of clinical applications. For short T2* mapping this sequence provides free choice of the second TE, usually within less scan time as a comparable dual echo UTE sequence. },

Single navigator readouts were interspersed using the same TR and a high navigator frequency of 54 Hz into a radial golden-angle acquisition. The extracted navigator function was thresholded to exclude data for reconstruction from inhalation phases during the breathing cycle, enabling free breathing acquisition. To minimize flow artifacts in the dynamic cine images a center-out half echo radial acquisition scheme with ramp sampling was used. Navigator functions were derived from the corresponding projection navigator data from which both respiration and cardiac cycles were extracted. Self-gated cine acquisition resulted in high-quality cardiac images which were free of major artifacts with spatial resolution of up to 0.21 × 0.21 × 1.00 mm(3) and a contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of 21 ± 3 between the myocardium and left ventricle.

abstract     = {The epidemic increase of non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) requires a deeper understanding of the regulatory circuits controlling the response of liver metabolism to nutritional challenges, medical drugs, and genetic enzyme variants. As in vivo studies of human liver metabolism are encumbered with serious ethical and technical issues, we developed a comprehensive biochemistry-based kinetic model of the central liver metabolism including the regulation of enzyme activities by their reactants, allosteric effectors, and hormone-dependent phosphorylation. The utility of the model for basic research and applications in medicine and pharmacology is illustrated by simulating diurnal variations of the metabolic state of the liver at various perturbations caused by nutritional challenges (alcohol), drugs (valproate), and inherited enzyme disorders (galactosemia). Using proteomics data to scale maximal enzyme activities, the model is used to highlight differences in the metabolic functions of normal hepatocytes and malignant liver cells (adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma).},

abstract     = {The considerable difficulty encountered in reproducing the results of published dynamical models limits validation, exploration and reuse of this increasingly large biomedical research resource. To address this problem, we have developed Tellurium Notebook, a software system for model authoring, simulation, and teaching that facilitates building reproducible dynamical models and reusing models by 1) providing a notebook environment which allows models, Python code, and narrative to be intermixed, 2) supporting the COMBINE archive format during model development for capturing model information in an exchangeable format and 3) enabling users to easily simulate and edit public COMBINE-compliant models from public repositories to facilitate studying model dynamics, variants and test cases. Tellurium Notebook, a Python-based Jupyter-like environment, is designed to seamlessly inter-operate with these community standards by automating conversion between COMBINE standards formulations and corresponding in-line, human-readable representations. Thus, Tellurium brings to systems biology the strategy used by other literate notebook systems such as Mathematica. These capabilities allow users to edit every aspect of the standards-compliant models and simulations, run the simulations in-line, and re-export to standard formats. We provide several use cases illustrating the advantages of our approach and how it allows development and reuse of models without requiring technical knowledge of standards. Adoption of Tellurium should accelerate model development, reproducibility and reuse.},

abstract        = {Disrupted bile secretion leads to liver damage characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, eventually cirrhosis, and hepatocellular cancer. As obstructive cholestasis often progresses insidiously, markers for the diagnosis and staging of the disease are urgently needed. To this end, we compiled a comprehensive data set of serum markers, histological parameters and transcript profiles at 8 time points of disease progression after bile duct ligation (BDL) in mice, aiming at identifying a set of parameters that could be used as robust biomarkers for transition of different disease progression phases. Statistical analysis of the more than 6,000 data points revealed distinct temporal phases of disease. Time course correlation analysis of biochemical, histochemical and mRNA transcript parameters (=factors) defined 6 clusters for different phases of disease progression. The number of CTGF-positive cells provided the most reliable overall measure for disease progression at histological level, bilirubin at biochemical level, and metalloproteinase inhibitor 1 (Timp1) at transcript level. Prominent molecular events exhibited by strong transcript peaks are found for the transcriptional regulator Nr0b2 (Shp) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) 24-hydroxylase (Cyp24a1) at 6 h. Based on these clusters, we constructed a decision tree of factor combinations potentially useful as markers for different time intervals of disease progression. Best prediction for onset of disease is achieved by fibronectin (Fn1), for early disease phase by Cytochrome P450 1A2 (Cyp1a2), passage to perpetuation phase by collagen1α-1 (Col1a1), and transition to the progression phase by interleukin 17-a (Il17a), with early and late progression separated by Col1a1. Notably, these predictions remained stable even for randomly chosen small sub-sets of factors selected from the clusters. Our detailed time-resolved explorative study of liver homogenates following BDL revealed a well-coordinated response, resulting in disease phase dependent parameter modulations at morphological, biochemical, metabolic and gene expression levels. Interestingly, a small set of selected parameters can be used as diagnostic markers to predict disease stages in mice with cholestatic liver disease.},

SBML is the most widely used standard for representing dynamic networks, especially biochemical networks. libRoadRunner is fast enough to support large-scale problems such as tissue models, studies that require large numbers of repeated runs and interactive simulations. libRoadRunner is a self-contained library, able to run both as a component inside other tools via its C++ and C bindings, and interactively through its Python interface. Its Python Application Programming Interface (API) is similar to the APIs of MATLAB ( WWWMATHWORKSCOM: ) and SciPy ( HTTP//WWWSCIPYORG/: ), making it fast and easy to learn. libRoadRunner uses a custom Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler built on the widely used LLVM JIT compiler framework. It compiles SBML-specified models directly into native machine code for a variety of processors, making it appropriate for solving extremely large models or repeated runs. libRoadRunner is flexible, supporting the bulk of the SBML specification (except for delay and non-linear algebraic equations) including several SBML extensions (composition and distributions). It offers multiple deterministic and stochastic integrators, as well as tools for steady-state analysis, stability analysis and structural analysis of the stoichiometric matrix. libRoadRunner binary distributions are available for Mac OS X, Linux and Windows. The library is licensed under Apache License Version 2.0. libRoadRunner is also available for ARM-based computers such as the Raspberry Pi. http://www.libroadrunner.org provides online documentation, full build instructions, binaries and a git source repository. hsauro@u.washington.edu or somogyie@indiana.edu Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract        = {This study focuses on a two-scale, continuum multicomponent model for the description of blood perfusion and cell metabolism in the liver. The model accounts for a spatial and time depending hydro-diffusion-advection-reaction description. We consider a solid-phase (tissue) containing glycogen and a fluid-phase (blood) containing glucose as well as lactate. The five-component model is enhanced by a two-scale approach including a macroscale (sinusoidal level) and a microscale (cell level). The perfusion on the macroscale within the lobules is described by a homogenized multiphasic approach based on the theory of porous media (mixture theory combined with the concept of volume fraction). On macro level, we recall the basic mixture model, the governing equations as well as the constitutive framework including the solid (tissue) stress, blood pressure and solutes chemical potential. In view of the transport phenomena, we discuss the blood flow including transverse isotropic permeability, as well as the transport of solute concentrations including diffusion and advection. The continuum multicomponent model on the macroscale finally leads to a coupled system of partial differential equations (PDE). In contrast, the hepatic metabolism on the microscale (cell level) was modeled via a coupled system of ordinary differential equations (ODE). Again, we recall the constitutive relations for cell metabolism level. A finite element implementation of this framework is used to provide an illustrative example, describing the spatial and time-depending perfusion-metabolism processes in liver lobules that integrates perfusion and metabolism of the liver. },

Model simulations are in good agreement with experimental data on (i) the quantitative contributions of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and glycogen metabolism to hepatic glucose production and hepatic glucose utilization under varying physiological states. (ii) the time courses of postprandial glycogen storage as well as glycogen depletion in overnight fasting and short term fasting (iii) the switch from net hepatic glucose production under hypoglycemia to net hepatic glucose utilization under hyperglycemia essential for glucose homeostasis (iv) hormone perturbations of hepatic glucose metabolism. Response analysis reveals an extra high capacity of the liver to counteract changes of plasma glucose level below 5 mM (hypoglycemia) and above 7.5 mM (hyperglycemia).

In this work, we investigated the hypothesis that metabolic reprogramming in combination with metabolic zonation of cellular energy metabolism are important factors in promotion of the growth capacity of solid tumors. A tissue-scale model of the two main ATP delivering pathways, glycolysis (GLY) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXP), was used to simulate the energy metabolism within solid tumors under various metabolic strategies. Remarkably, despite the high diversity in the usage of glucose, lactate and oxygen in various spatial regions, the tumor as a whole clearly displays the hallmark of the so-called Warburg effect, i.e. a high rate of glucose consumption and lactate production in the presence of sufficiently high levels of oxygen. Our simulations suggest that an increase in GLY capacity and concomitant decrease in OXP capacity from the periphery towards the center of the tumor improves the availability of oxygen to pericentral tumor cells. The found relationship between the regional oxygen level and the relative share of GLY and OXP capacities supports the view that metabolite availability functions as key regulator of tumor energy metabolism. },

It is based on the manual evaluation of >1500 original scientific research publications to warrant a high-quality evidence-based model. The final network is the result of an iterative process of data compilation and rigorous computational testing of network functionality by means of constraint-based modeling techniques. Taking the hepatic detoxification of ammonia as an example, we show how the availability of nutrients and oxygen may modulate the interplay of various metabolic pathways to allow an efficient response of the liver to perturbations of the homeostasis of blood compounds.},

	abstract = {Quantitative magnetic susceptibility mapping (QSM) has recently been introduced to provide a novel quantitative and local MRI contrast. However, the anatomical contrast represented by in vivo susceptibility maps has not yet been compared systematically and comprehensively with gradient (recalled) echo (GRE) magnitude, frequency, and R(2)(*) images. Therefore, this study compares high-resolution quantitative susceptibility maps with conventional GRE imaging approaches (magnitude, frequency, R(2)(*)) in healthy individuals at 7 T with respect to anatomic tissue contrast. Volumes-of-interest were analyzed in deep and cortical gray matter (GM) as well as in white matter (WM) on R(2)(*) and susceptibility maps. High-resolution magnetic susceptibility maps of the human brain exhibited superb contrast that allowed the identification of substructures of the thalamus, midbrain and basal ganglia, as well as of the cerebral cortex. These were consistent with histology but not generally visible on magnitude, frequency or R(2)(*)-maps. Common target structures for deep brain stimulation, including substantia nigra pars reticulata, ventral intermediate nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, and the substructure of the internal globus pallidus, were clearly distinguishable from surrounding tissue on magnetic susceptibility maps. The laminar substructure of the cortical GM differed depending on the anatomical region, i.e., a cortical layer with increased magnetic susceptibility, corresponding to the Stria of Gennari, was found in the GM of the primary visual cortex, V1, whereas a layer with reduced magnetic susceptibility was observed in the GM of the temporal cortex. Both magnetic susceptibility and R(2)(*) values differed substantially in cortical GM depending on the anatomic regions. Regression analysis between magnetic susceptibility and R(2)(*) values of WM and GM structures suggested that variations in myelin content cause the overall contrast between gray and white matter on susceptibility maps and that both R(2)(*) and susceptibility values provide linear measures for iron content in GM. In conclusion, quantitative magnetic susceptibility mapping provides a non-invasive and spatially specific contrast that opens the door to the assessment of diseases characterized by variation in iron and/or myelin concentrations. Its ability to reflect anatomy of deep GM structures with superb delineation may be useful for neurosurgical applications.},

	abstract = {Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) based on gradient echo (GRE) magnetic resonance phase data is a novel technique for non-invasive assessment of magnetic tissue susceptibility differences. The method is expected to be an important means to determine iron distributions in vivo and may, thus, be instrumental for elucidating the physiological role of iron and disease-related iron concentration changes associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders. This study introduces a framework for QSM and demonstrates calculation of reproducible and orientation-independent susceptibility maps from GRE data acquired at 3T. The potential of these susceptibility maps to perform anatomical imaging is investigated, as well as the ability to measure the venous blood oxygen saturation level in large vessels, and to assess the local tissue iron concentration. In order to take into account diamagnetic susceptibility contributions induced by myelin, a correction scheme for susceptibility based iron estimation is demonstrated. The findings suggest that susceptibility contrast, and therewith also phase contrast, are not only linked to the storage iron concentration but are also significantly influenced by other sources such as myelin. After myelin correction the linear dependence between magnetic susceptibilities and previously published iron concentrations from post mortem studies was significantly improved. Finally, a comparison between susceptibility maps and processed phase images indicated that caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions about iron concentrations when directly assessing processed phase information.},

	abstract = {Susceptibility differences between tissues can be utilized as a new type of contrast in MRI that is different from spin density, T1-, or T2-weighted imaging. Signals from substances with different magnetic susceptibilities compared to their neighboring tissue will become out of phase with these tissues at sufficiently long echo times (TEs). Thus, phase imaging offers a means of enhancing contrast in MRI. Specifically, the phase images themselves can provide excellent contrast between gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), iron-laden tissues, venous blood vessels, and other tissues with susceptibilities that are different from the background tissue. Also, for the first time, projection phase images are shown to demonstrate tissue (vessel) continuity. In this work, the best approach for combining magnitude and phase images is discussed. The phase images are high-pass-filtered and then transformed to a special phase mask that varies in amplitude between zero and unity. This mask is multiplied a few times into the original magnitude image to create enhanced contrast between tissues with different susceptibilities. For this reason, this method is referred to as susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Mathematical arguments are presented to determine the number of phase mask multiplications that should take place. Examples are given for enhancing GM/WM contrast and water/fat contrast, identifying brain iron, and visualizing veins in the brain.},

abstract        = {Liver resection can lead to focal outflow obstruction due to transection of hepatic veins. Outflow obstruction may cause additional damage to the small remnant liver. Drainage of the obstructed territories is reestablished via dilatation of sinusoids. Subsequently, sinusoidal canals are formed draining the blood from the obstructed territory to the neighboring unobstructed territories. We raised the phenomenological hypothesis that the blood pressure gradient is the main driving force for the formation of sinusoidal vascular canals. We generated a biphasic mechanical model to describe this vascular remodeling process in relation to the variable pressure gradient. Therefore, we introduced a transverse isotropic permeability relation as well as an evolutional optimization rule to describe the relationship between pressure gradient and the direction of the sinusoidal blood flow in the fluid phase. As a next step, we developed a framework for the calculation concept including the representation of the governing weak formulations. Then, we examined a representative numerical example with simulation of the blood flow under both conditions, the physiological situation as well as after outflow obstruction. Doing so, we were able to reproduce numerically the experimentally observed process of reestablishing hepatic venous drainage via redirection of blood flow and formation of new vascular structures in respect to the fluid flow. The calculated results support the hypothesis that the reorientation of blood flow mainly depends on the pressure gradient. Further investigations are needed to determine the micromechanical influences on the reorientation of the sinusoids.},

	abstract        = {The liver is the central organ for detoxification of xenobiotics in the body. In pharmacokinetic modeling, hepatic metabolization capacity is typically quantified as hepatic clearance computed as degradation in well-stirred compartments. This is an accurate mechanistic description once a quasi-equilibrium between blood and surrounding tissue is established. However, this model structure cannot be used to simulate spatio-temporal distribution during the first instants after drug injection. In this paper, we introduce a new spatially resolved model to simulate first pass perfusion of compounds within the naive liver. The model is based on vascular structures obtained from computed tomography as well as physiologically based mass transfer descriptions obtained from pharmacokinetic modeling. The physiological architecture of hepatic tissue in our model is governed by both vascular geometry and the composition of the connecting hepatic tissue. In particular, we here consider locally distributed mass flow in liver tissue instead of considering well-stirred compartments. Experimentally, the model structure corresponds to an isolated perfused liver and provides an ideal platform to address first pass effects and questions of hepatic heterogeneity. The model was evaluated for three exemplary compounds covering key aspects of perfusion, distribution and metabolization within the liver. As pathophysiological states we considered the influence of steatosis and carbon tetrachloride-induced liver necrosis on total hepatic distribution and metabolic capacity. Notably, we found that our computational predictions are in qualitative agreement with previously published experimental data. The simulation results provide an unprecedented level of detail in compound concentration profiles during first pass perfusion, both spatio-temporally in liver tissue itself and temporally in the outflowing blood. We expect our model to be the foundation of further spatially resolved models of the liver in the future. },

	abstract        = {The mammalian liver plays a key role for metabolism and detoxification of xenobiotics in the body. The corresponding biochemical processes are typically subject to spatial variations at different length scales. Zonal enzyme expression along sinusoids leads to zonated metabolization already in the healthy state. Pathological states of the liver may involve liver cells affected in a zonated manner or heterogeneously across the whole organ. This spatial heterogeneity, however, cannot be described by most computational models which usually consider the liver as a homogeneous, well-stirred organ. The goal of this article is to present a methodology to extend whole-body pharmacokinetics models by a detailed liver model, combining different modeling approaches from the literature. This approach results in an integrated four-scale model, from single cells via sinusoids and the organ to the whole organism, capable of mechanistically representing metabolization inhomogeneity in livers at different spatial scales. Moreover, the model shows circulatory mixing effects due to a delayed recirculation through the surrounding organism. To show that this approach is generally applicable for different physiological processes, we show three applications as proofs of concept, covering a range of species, compounds, and diseased states: clearance of midazolam in steatotic human livers, clearance of caffeine in mouse livers regenerating from necrosis, and a parameter study on the impact of different cell entities on insulin uptake in mouse livers. The examples illustrate how variations only discernible at the local scale influence substance distribution in the plasma at the whole-body level. In particular, our results show that simultaneously considering variations at all relevant spatial scales may be necessary to understand their impact on observations at the organism scale. },

	abstract        = {Physiologically realistic geometric models of the vasculature in the liver are indispensable for modelling hepatic blood flow, the main connection between the liver and the organism. Current in vivo imaging techniques do not provide sufficiently detailed vascular trees for many simulation applications, so it is necessary to use algorithmic refinement methods. The method of Constrained Constructive Optimization (CCO) (Schreiner et al., 2006) is well suited for this purpose. Its results after calibration have been previously compared to experimentally acquired human vascular trees (Schwen and Preusser, 2012). The goal of this paper is to extend this calibration to the case of rodents (mice and rats), the most commonly used animal models in liver research. Based on in vivo and ex vivo micro-CT scans of rodent livers and their vasculature, we performed an analysis of various geometric features of the vascular trees. Starting from pruned versions of the original vascular trees, we applied the CCO procedure and compared these algorithmic results to the original vascular trees using a suitable similarity measure. The calibration of the postprocessing improved the algorithmic results compared to those obtained using standard CCO. In terms of angular features, the average similarity increased from 0.27 to 0.61, improving the total similarity from 0.28 to 0.40. Finally, we applied the calibrated algorithm to refine measured vascular trees to the (higher) level of detail desired for specific applications. Having successfully adapted the CCO algorithm to the rodent model organism, the resulting individual-specific refined hepatic vascular trees can now be used for advanced modeling involving, e.g., detailed blood flow simulations. },

However, it remains difficult to study, whether the loss of metabolizing tissue is sufficient to explain loss of metabolic capacity of the liver or whether the surviving tissue undergoes an adaptive response to compensate the loss. To understand the cellular impact of toxic liver damage in an in vivo situation, we here used physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modelling to investigate pharmacokinetics of a specifically designed drug cocktail at three different sampling sites of the body in healthy mice and mice treated with carbon tetrachloride (CCl ). Liver zonation was explicitly quantified in the models through immunostaining of cytochrome P450s enzymes. Comparative analyses between the simulated decrease in clearance capacity and the experimentally measured loss in tissue volume indicated that CCl -induced impairment of metabolic functions goes beyond the mere loss of metabolically active tissue. The here established integrative modelling strategy hence provides mechanistic insights into functional consequences of toxic liver damage in an in vivo situation, which would not have been accessible by conventional methods.},
