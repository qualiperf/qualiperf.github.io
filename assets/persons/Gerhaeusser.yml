  description: 'Steffen Gerh채usser is a doctoral researcher of the project P7 - "Modeling of function-perfusion-deformation interaction on liver lobulus and cellular scale
  based on a bi-scale continuum FEM model". He is working under the guidance of Prof. Dr.-Ing Tim Ricken on numercial simulation of liver tissue based on the 
  theory of porous media (TPM). His main research topic is the coupling of macro perfusion processes on the lobule scale using the Finite Element Method (FEM ) 
  with reaction networks on the cell scale using an SBML based ODE solver.'
